Introduction

Informal inspection of Western Hemlocks (Tsuga heterophylla, TSHE) in the one hundred acre
old-growth forest at Seward Park, on April 9th 2021, by GSP forest steward and Friends of Seward
Park (FoSP) board member Paul Shannon, accompanied and supervised by WSU plant pathologist Marianne
Elliott, and UW ecologist Tim Billo, found that the hemlocks are diseased and dying at higher than
historical and background rates.

FoSP has allied with CHOOSE 180, a community-centered effort in partnership with the King County
Prosecuting Attorney's Office to reduce race-based and economic disproportionality in incarceration,
to keep youth out of the juvenile justice system, and to break the school-to-prison pipeline.

Together FoSP and CHOOSE 180, were awarded a $4500 Department of Neighborhoods (DoN) Small Sparks
Fund grant to employ a small group of at-risk youth to survey hemlock status in a large sample plot
at Seward Park during the summer of 2021, supervised pro bono by Shannon, under the scientific
guidance of Elliott, Billo, with the advice and consent of Seattle Parks plant ecologists.

DoN funding will pay minimum wage to 2-5 youth selected by CHOOSE 180, for 4-6 weeks, 4 hours a day, four
days a week, and for the purchase of a GPS device and a clinometer.  We propose a formal, staged
inspection of a central four and a half acre (1.8 hectare) section of the forest, compatible with
the methods and data standards of the US Forest Service Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, to
achieve these five goals:

  1) Establish the current count, size and health status of Tsuga heterophylla in this
     large, central and representative plot.

  2) Introduce two to five at-risk Choose 180 youth into the methods of field biology and data
     analysis.

  3) Provide affected plant tissue to WSU plant pathologist Dr. Marianne Elliott for analysis.

  4) Contribute our observations to the WSU-afffilated Forest Health Watch project

  5) Contribute to the long-term ecological monitoring of Seward Park's rare old-growth forest.

The context for, and the urgency of this project is captured in a recent study published in the
journal Nature: "Over half of western United States' most abundant tree species in decline" (Stanke
et al, Nature Communications, January 2021).  PNW tree species are in apparent decline as well
(Bigleaf Maple, Western Redcedar, and - of immediate concern at Seward - the Western Hemlock). We
will emulate the FIA and Stankeprojects, measuring the same standard FIA attributes, though adapting
the FIA plot selection protocol to Seward's forest and the educational needs of the CHOOSE 180
youth.

Methods

We propose to collect data consistent with FAI surveys, which to date include 24,000 repeated
censuses over several decades.  See https://www.fia.fs.fed.us.

FAI plot surveys are executed quickly by professional foresters, on 1/6 acre sample plots and
subplots, measuring all trees of target species > 1" DBH. We shall collect the same per-tree data on
hemlocks in a single large, central, representative plot.  This contiguous single area is 4.6 acres
(1.8 hectare) and thus differs from FIA's standard, randomized 1/6 acre, four subplot scheme.  FIA's
plots are motivated by scarce labor and a continental scale, factors not applicable at
Seward. Nonetheless, standard FIA "TPA" or "TPH" summaries (trees per acre or hectare) will be
provided at the conclusion of our study.

Our Seward TSHE survey is not constrained by the FAI need for efficiency at scale, but is instead
shaped by the nature of our work force.  These youths will be initially scientifically naive.
However, and incontrast to FIA, we have the luxury of ample time: the DoN grant provides funding for
at least 4 weeks, 16 hours per week for 2-5 youths.  This permits two modifications of the FAI
protocol, in plot selection, and in methodology:

  1) We will survey a 4.5 acre (1.8 hectare) region of Seward's Forest, contained by the Windfall
     and sqebeqd trails, in which approximately 80 TSHE are found, of all sizes and health status.

  2) We will use a slow, staged methodology, with careful instruction at each stage, including
     a) Species identification
     b) Temporary tree flagging
     c) DBH and height measurement of approximately 80 trees, all sizes, dead and alive
     d) Health assessment via needle distribution (crown, middle, base) adapting (per Marianne
        Elliott) the Dwarf Mistletoe Rating system (DMR), substituting defoliation for mistletoe
        infection.  See https://forestpathology.org/parasitic-plants/dwarf-mistletoe/ecology/
     e) Reporting affected trees to Marianne Elliott for subsequent needle and twig collection,
        and laboratory analysis

Deliverables

At the conclusion of the study, we will produce and archive  per-acre and per-hectare (TPA and
TPH) statistics consistent with the data schema of the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and
Analysis Plots.  

These data set up and enable future repeat surveys of the plot, as well as other possible surveys at Seward,
using the forest stability index (FSI) proposed by Stanke et al, to track change over time, or some
similar metric.

In addition, we hope to submit a research note to Douglasia, the journal of the Washington Native Plant
Society.

Affected hemlock needle and tissue samples will be provided to Marianne Elliott for analysis in the WSU
Puyallup Plant Pathology laboratory, possibly leading to greater understanding of the hemlock decline.
