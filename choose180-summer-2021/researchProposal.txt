Introduction

Informal inspection of Western Hemlocks (Tsuga heterophylla, TSHE) in the
one hundred acre old-growth forest at Seward Park suggests that they
are diseased and dying at higher than historical and background rates.
We propose a formal, staged inspection of a central five acre section
of the forest, to achieve three goals:

  1) Establish the current count, size and health status
     of Tsuga heterophylla.

  2) Introduce two to five at-risk Choose 180 youth into the methods of field
     biology and data analysis.

  3) Provide affected plant tissue to WSU plant pathologist
     Dr. Marianne Elliott for analysis.

Background

Our goal is to establish the current state of hemlocks and to provide
a baseline for repeat assays in subsequent years.   Three
inter-related topics arise:

  1) sampling strategy
  2) monitoring protocol to be applied to selected samples
  3) compatibility with regional and national programs with similar aims

A recently published high-profile journal article provides a basis
with which to address these topics:

  "Over half of western United States' most abundant tree species in
   decline", Stanke et al, Nature Communications, January 2021.

This study uses repeat measures of trees in 24,000 US Forest Service
Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots.  The authors propose a relative
tree density assay in which current ("absolute") densities
are compared to the "maximum theoretical density the stand could
achieve given its ovserved tree size-distribution".  FIA data and a
simple model provide the theoretical density; field measurements
determine the current absolute density.  Our goal in this project is
to make a first contribution to the historical record, providing tree
height, diameter, crown characteristics and health estimates of
Western Hemlock at Seward Park.  By collecting standard Phase 3 FIA
data, the tracking and management of Seward's forest will
benefit from its compatibility with ongoing FIA research. 

Unlike the FIA, which uses sampling techniques and frequencies adapted
to a continental scale and budget constraints, the Seward Park hemlock
project will use a trail-enclosed 4.5 acre (1.8 hectare) section in
the center of Seward's old-growth forest.  Preliminary data show that
this area has classic old-growth confirmation, with multiple species
of a range of ages and health status, includng approximately 80
hemlocks of various status and size.

A traditional FAI strategy suggests a different approach: four closely
spaced 48' diameter circles, totalling one-sixth of an acre,
constitute a plot.  On average, one of these is created for every
96,000 acres.  Twenty-seven such FIA "Phase 3" plots could replace our
single 4.5 acre plots.  However, given the heterogeneity of the 4.5
acre plot, its centrality within the forest, and the completeness of
the survey we propose, this will provide an excellent baseline, and
the opportunity for repeatable measures in eyears to come.

The single 4.5 acre plot has two advantages.  First, this selected
region of Seward's forest is representative of the older, generally
healthier regions of the one hundred acre forest.  Due to its size  -
27 times the standard FIA plot - and the nature of Seward's forest,
more representative heterogeneity is obtained.  Large Douglas firs
and cedars as well as hemlock and maple are present in good number
here. The sword fern die-off is not yet pervasive.  The area is central to the
forest and thus maximally removed from forest edge effects, of human
visitors and ambient pollution.   This region of the forest is
possibly the healthiest in the forest, despite having dead and dying
hemlocks and the early stages of sword fern decline.  

Didactive concerns also strongly recommend this large single-site
approach.  Our project will be staffed by young workers who are new to
the woods and untrained in field biology.  By sticking with one large
site, they will acquire detailed knowledge by visiting it many times a
week over 4-6 weeks.  They are expected to progress from 
species recognition skills, to mastery of GPS and clinometer readings,
of diameter measurements and crown description, of needle photography
and sample collection for Marianne Elliott's lab at WSU Puyallup.

For all of these reasons, this 4.5 acre plot provides the optimum
balance of baseline measurement and educational virtues.

Methods

The apparent hemlock decline may be related to other PNW areal tree
decline (Western Redcedar and Bigleaf Maple).  Methods and context for
the proposed study are provided by research just published in Nature
Communications: "Over half of western United States most abundant tree
species in decline." <fn1>  We propose to collect data consistent with
the Forest Stability Index (FSI) developed in this paper, which 
draws in turn upon 24,000 repeated censuses of the US Forest Service Forest
Inventory and Analysis Plots (FAI).

FAI plot surveys are executed quickly by professional foresters, on
1-acre sample plots and adjacent subplots, measuring all trees of
target species > 1" DBH.

The proposed Seward TSHE survey is not constrained by the FAI need for
efficiency at scale.  Though our workers will be initially
scientifically naive, we have the luxury of ample time: a City of
Seattle Department of Neighborhoods grant provides funding for at least 4
weeks, 16 hours per week for 2-5 youths, led by GSP Forest Steward
Paul Shannon pro bono.   This permits two modifications of the FAI protocol:

  1) We will survey a 4.5 acre (1.8 hectare) region of Seward's
     Forest, contained by the Windfall and sqebeqd trails, in which
     approximately 80 TSHE are found, of all sizes and health status.

  2) We propose a staged methodology:
     a) Species identification
     b) Temporary tree flagging
     c) DBH measurement, height estimation
     d) health assessment:  needle distribution (crown, middle, base),
        needle health
     e) needle & twig sample selection and collection
        
Deliverables

Total, per-acre and per-hectare statistics fully consistent with the
data schema of the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis
Plots.  This enables successive surveys, and surveys elsewhere at
Seward, to be employed with the standardized forest demographic index
from Stanke et al, to track change over time.
