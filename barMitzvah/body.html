<h3 style="margin-top: 20px"> The Bar Mitzvah Site (11 July 2020)</h3>

Some of the forest regulars encoutered self-identified Bar Mitzvah
celebrants in early July.  We later discovered that members of this
group, no doubt with good intentions, but lacking our usual sense of
the fragility of the forest, and the need to leave it undisturbed:
<ul>
  <li> cleared, cut and marked a fresh trail
  <li> created a 20' diameter clearing, which included the cutting of a large, mature
    hazelnut shrub
  <li> carried in and distributed  gravel to mark the clearing's circumference
    <li> held a large celebration
</ul>

<h2> August 9th, 2020: Closing the Trail</h2>

<h3>Before</h3>
<p>
The trail leading into the celebration circle is hard to see in this
photo because of sunlight.  However it is quite obvious in person, and a
temptation to curious passers by.  It runs roughly parallel and to the
left of the large doug fir log.  Today we closed and tried to obscure
this trail at its junction with the Andrews Bay Trail.
