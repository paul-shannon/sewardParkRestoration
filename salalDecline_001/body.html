A possible decline in the salal understory has been suggested in
sword fern die-off discussions since at least 2016.  But it was only
this week (mid-August 2020) that I first saw a possible instance, with
many large dead plants in a small area.
<p>
Or maybe this is natural senescence of an old salal clone?   From the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/shrub/gausha/all.html"
       target="_blank">US Forest Service</a>:

<blockquote>
Salal leaves generally live for 2 to 4 years.  Twigs survive for 16
years or longer, but bear leaves only during the first few years.
Rhizomatous portions of individual plants can live for hundreds of years
</blockquote>


<p>
Here we report an area about 50' wide by 30' deep on the west side of
the sqebeqsed trail as it descends towards the north beach.  There is
plenty of sword fern die-off here also.  The dead salal plants seem to
be old and tall.  The concentration of dead salal branches and leaves
in this area strikes me as unusual.
