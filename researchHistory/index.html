<h3>A History of Sword Fern Die-Off Research</h3>

This history primarily describes work which addressed, the
die-off of Polystichum munitum in the early old-growth forest in
Seward Park, Seattle.

<h4>Autumn 2013: Catherine Alexander's Initial Report</h4>

The sword fern die-off was first noticed by Catherine Alexander
(naturalist and daily visitor to Seward) in the autumn of 2013.  Here
is her account, offered on October 28th, 2014:
<p>
The Sword Ferns near the hatchery and along the northern end of the
hidden trail above that area began to fail about a year ago, though
the first signs were quite subtle - just a sense that they were
somehow sagging, as if they'd been covered with cardboard for a week
or two. At the time I estimated that perhaps 40% of the population was
affected.
<p>
I kept watch over the winter, thinking that what I was seeing was a
temporary thing, that the ferns would recover when their fiddleheads
appeared in spring. That was not to be. None of the affected ferns
produced fiddleheads this spring, and by late spring the remaining
fronds withered and died.
<p>
By July I noticed that whatever was happening had spread beyond the
initial 40%, though it could be that I just hadn't seen the first
signs of failure in the seemingly unaffected population.  I monitored
spore production in and around the affected areas this year, and
noticed that many of the apparently healthy individuals either failed
to produce sori, or that their sori were sparse and
underdeveloped. Many of these individuals failed over the summer.

<h4>October 13th 2014:  Video walkthrough of the area</h4>

<h4>November 2014: Seattle Parks staff visit to the affected area</h4>

Several members of the Friends of Seward Park (Paul Shannon, Paul
Talbert, Al Smith) and Seattle Parks staff (Gail Takeoka, Jeanne
Schollmeyer and plant ecologist Jillian Weed) visited the affected
area.  General puzzlement was shared.  Jillian proposed an informal
monitoring project: we planted two young nursery-sourced sword ferns
in December; almost one year later these two ferns are growing slowly
and seem to be healthy. I watered them weekly over the dry summer.
<p>
Update, June 2021.  One of these two ferns died in the first year.
The other continues to thrive, and inspired the 36 fern planting
described below.

<h4>November 2015</h4>

Tuesday November 10th, Dr. Marianne Elliott and Jenny Glass
(Diagnostic Plant Pathologist) braved the traffic and drove up to
Seward Park from the WSU Plant and Insect Diagnostic Laboratory in
Puyallup.
<p>

Accompanied by undergraduate students Tristan O'Mara, Kramer Canup and
me, Marianne and Jenny spent a couple of hours inspecting the extended
die-off site, and collecting soil and leaf samples from affected sites
and a mostly healthy region (Kramer and Tristan's 5x5m "Plot 1").

<p>
Jenny describes her self as a lab generalist (a most expert
generalist, it seems to me).  Marianne is a research plant pathologist
who, among other things, has coordinated (and is celebrated for)
Washington's statewide response to Sudden Oak Death.  She is active in
phytophthora research.  Though previous tests for Phytophthora came up
negative (Jenny in 2014, Olaf Ribeiro in spring 2015) Marianne
suggests that a closer and more sustained examination is worthwhile.

<p>
The site visit resulted in what is, at present, a very tentatively
held hypothesis.  Marianne noticed small and mostly dead cedar
seedlings, about 12 inches tall, each marked with a red-on-white
plastic tag, in and around ground zero.  We found several of these up
above the north-facing ground zero slope, the flat area where
Catherine Alexander first noticed signs of distress and die-off.

<p>
Lisa Cieko learned from fellow Parks plant ecologist, Michael Yadrick,
that these tagged cedar seedings were among 10,520 bareroot cedars
Parks contractors had planted throughout the forest in February of
2011.  Lisa adds: one article that I found did says that this could be
an issue -
<p>

     Root Rot of Western Swordfern Caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi in
     California.
<p>

The abstract mentions that the "pathogen was inadvertently brought to
the site via rhododendron nursery stock".
<p>

Thus we have a conjecture, a hypothesis, and the good fortune to also
have experts both skilled and experienced to test it out.  Their lab
methods may also reveal other candidates, may suggest other
hypotheses.  We are very grateful to Marianne and Jenny!

<h4>Kramer Canup, The Mountain Beaver Hypothesis</h4>

I just sent out a link to the shared drive spreadsheet containing the
fern data. If you wish to play around with this data, copy and paste
it onto another spreadsheet so that none of the numbers get out of
place. I do have a backup document but wish for the one posted to stay
nice and organized.

I agree with Tristan that the mountain beavers appear to be having
more and more of an impact on the fern population as we continue to
further explore around the forests at Seward Park. We came across one
section today that looked as if it had been mauled by a pack of
mountains beavers. Numerous ferns were completely smashed and
flattened as if they had been trampled by a large animal, but the only
sign of disturbance appeared to be from mountain beavers. As the
surrounding vegetation was not disturbed and countless fronds had been
snipped from the smashed ferns.

Today it seemed that nearly everywhere we walked, we were coming
across active mountain beaver dens. We were also thinking that if the
system of dens is extensive enough and shallow enough beneath the
surface, that this could possible pose problems for increased drought
stress on the plants present through disturbing the soil layers and
reducing the soils ability to retain moisture throughout the summer.

As posed numerous times by Tim, I also believe that 5 to 10 exclosure
plots in areas where we know mountain beavers are present would be the
most effective way to collect quantitative data on the mountain
beavers interaction with the sword ferns. Possibly, using the same
protocols we have been using for the current 20 plots, we could set up
3x3 exclosure plots inside of larger 5x5 vegetative plots.

This way we could have an initial data collection on the health of all
ferns within the 5x5 plot and then leave the 3x3 exclosure in place
for multiple months and come back and re survey the plot and quantify
the impact of the mountain beavers on the sword fern population by
comparing the amount of fronds removed from the ferns within the 3x3
exclosure and outside of the 3x3 exclosure.

Many things to ponder here, but seeing that nothing significant is
coming from the soil and root samples, testing other hypothesis now
may be very worthy.

Update, June 16th 2021.  The exclosure and control plots showed
no difference in mortality.  The experiment was conclude in 2017(?)

<h4>November 2016: Katie Coats and Marianne Elliott of the WSU Plant Diagnostics Lab in Puyallup: a report after PCR assay of Phytophthora at the genus level
(received 18 November 2016)

(In early November, I collected samples from a healthy fern - fine
roots and nearby soil - off the windfall trail, and from an affected
surviving fern just west of ground zero, and delivered them to Katie
in her lab - Paul Shannon)
 
I have qPCR results on the sword fern samples but they're not
conclusive.

I extracted DNA from the following samples:
<ol>
 <li> "healthy soil a" = 4 grams of soil from 12" away from healthy plant
 <li> "healthy soil b" = 4 grams of soil from 24" away from healthy plant
 <li> "healthy plant" = roots, surface sterilized in 10% bleach for 1 minute then rinsed twice in sterile water to assure qPCR is detecting infection inside the roots, photo attached
 <li> "affected soil" = 4 grams of soil from near affected plant
 <li> "affected plant a" = roots, surface sterilized in 10% bleach for 1 minute then rinsed twice in sterile water, photo attached
 <li> "affected plant b" = split from sample 5, run as a replicate

The DNA samples were run in duplicate through the general Phytophthora
(5.8S) qPCR assay along with a positive control (DNA from a pure
culture of Phytophthora) and a negative control (water). All samples
were multiplexed with an amplification control that checks for
evidence of PCR inhibition, something that’s common in root and soil
samples.

Results are shown in the bar graph below… it’s crude… I don’t usually
use the Ct values, but I think it’s a quick way to get the results
across to you. The lower the Ct value, the more target DNA is present…
so it makes sense that the pure DNA sample has a Ct around 16.  The
qPCR runs up to 42 cycles, but data above 40 cycles is dubious. If no
phytophthora is present, then there will be no Ct value at all, which
was the case with the water control. Theoretically the DNA doubles in
each cycle, so a Ct value one more than another represents twice as
much target DNA.


The bottom line is that the healthy soil and plant generally had lower
Ct values (more Phytophthora DNA) than the affected soil and plant. I
don’t have a soil sample from another location outside the park to
give us an idea of how normal these levels of phytophthora are, but
they’re counter what we expected...  One thing to keep in mind is that
this test lumps all phytophthoras together, so it remains possible
that a causal phytophthora is in higher concentration in the affected
plant even though the total amount of phytophthora is lower.

Therefore, we will proceed with another strategy referred to as
baiting. We’ll add some rhododendron leaves as baits to the individual
plant and soil samples along with water… and then plate in culture
medium to see if/how much/which phytophthoras may be present. That
will take a couple weeks from start to finish… so more wait time.</h4>

<p>
<h4>
Some Comments on PCR Results from Paul Talbert
November 18th and 20th, 2016</h4>


Thanks, Katie.

I guess I am relieved we don't find evidence for Phytophtora
infection, but that leaves us with no good hypothesis.

I'll look forward to hearing about the bait experiments. Meanwhile, I
guess we should try to think of other hypotheses.
 
So thinking out loud here, it looks like your positive control has
about 16,000 times as much Phytophthora DNA as the healthy soil, which
has about 4x as much as the affected soil. The latter difference may
be within sampling variability/error. So there is no evidence that a
Phytophthora is causing our problem, but we do apparently have
Phytophthoras in our soils, since nothing came up in the water.

Assuming we get nothing of interest again in the bait experiment,
would there be any point in repeating the experiment on growing roots
in the spring when the fiddleheads are coming out? I don't want to
chase phantoms or beat a dead horsetail (that was a fern ally joke),
just wondering if we could be missing anything. You don't have to
answer now; we have till spring to consider.

Comments, links and papers resulting from email sent to University of California fern biologists, and allies, on February 2nd 2017, who all generously responded.
My email:

Here in Seattle, and now apparently in a few locations in the Puget
lowland, we are witnessing a novel die-off of sword ferns.

We have been tracking and monitoring the die-off for two years in
league with plant pathologists from WSU and ecologists from the
University of Washington. Phytophthora was suspected, but repeated PCR
tests have so far been negative.  The cause is unknown.

The full story is presented, along with narrative history, maps,
videos, and lab reports here:

   http://sewardparkswordferndieoff.blogspot.com

Since we do not have marker or assay for a pathogen, our tracking of
the apparent spread is imprecise, and thus subject to both under- and
over-interpretation.

One way to improve our tracking - and my motivation for writing - is
for me to learn as much as possible about the habits of Polystichum
munitum.  Could you direct me to resources for such an education?

To give an example of what I don't know: nowhere I have been able to
learn the typical life span of the sword fern, with what mean and what
variability.  Perhaps the current age of a fern could be inferred by
traces left by now absent fronds?

Alan Smith, research botanist at UC Berkeley Herbarium (retired) My
observation is that plants of this species in my yard live a long
time, 25+ years.  Gradually, by either forking of the apex or by
adventitious shoots (or both), new crowns are formed that radiate out
from the original crown.  One plant becomes two, which becomes four
and so on, in close proximity.  I doubt that in a mature redwood
forest there is much sexual propagation, from spore dispersal -- that
seems to happen in more open or exposed areas, maybe semi-disturbed,
road banks, trailsides, etc. In a mature redwood forest, the plants on
the forest floor then must be essentially a clone, or many clones from
some original establishment(s)... So the populations could be
hundreds, if not thousands of years old, depending on disturbance and
openings in the canopy.  But I have never seen good documentation of
this, either long-term ecological studies or molecular studies.

David Wagner, Director and Curator of the University of Oregon
Herbarium 1976 to 1993, currently operates the Northwest Botanical
Institute There is no way to accurately [date] old sword ferns
although it is clear some are quite ancient. Many years ago I had a
group of students in a summer Ferntastic Ferns course study a
population of relatively young ferns. Each student dug up a single
fern that had only one apex or crown. Most old ferns have multiple
crowns because the stems branch regularly and often extensively. In
these single crown ferns we counted the number of fronds produced in
that year and then counted stipe bases as far back as possible. Most
of these still possessed stipe bases all the way to the tapered base
because they are so resistant to decay. The average number of stipe
bases divided by the average per year gave us an average age of
something like 50 years (can’t lay my hands on class notes
immediately). This had to be an underestimate because in the early
years of life they do not produce as many fronds per year. I’ve never
published this because it is so generalized but it tells you why I
believe sword ferns live for centuries. They often survive stand
destroying forest fires, so it is not unreasonable to presume many
ferns are older than the trees in the canopy above them.

The other thing known is that reproduction is only sporadic and
dependent on disturbance. I never found juvenile plants in a mature
forest floor. Gametophytes grow well only on mineral soil such as root
balls, landslides or artificial sites as road and trail cuts.

I have some population data in my monograph of Polystichum (1979.
Systematics of Polystichum in western North America north of Mexico.
Pteridologia 1: 1-64). I will attach below a pdf of a paper that
includes Polystichum.  (see "Belowground traits of herbaceous species
in young coniferous forests of the Olympic Peninsula, Washington",
below)


Consulting with east coast fern biologists on longevity:

Dr. David Barrington, University of Vermont, Professor of Plant
Biology, Polystichum genus expert

I very much like the idea that they are old individuals, established
at a remote time when there was disturbance in the forest.  Fire would
create such a disturbance.  As to age, 1000 years is not out of the
question, possibly much longer but there are no data at all for
deciding. There are very few sites for the establishment of new plants
via gametophyte in the stable mature forests of the Northwest, though
a single treefall would create such an opportunity.  Polystichum
munitum is essentially unbranched, which lends support to the idea
that the populations are made up of independently originated
individuals, not fragments of some giant clone.

 Dr. Robbin Moran, Curator at the Institute of Systematic Botany, New
 York Botanical Garden:

If I had to guess, I would say that the individuals are probably very
old, perhaps dating back to the time of original disturbance in the
area. This seems likely given that there seems to be little or no
sexual reproduction going on, and the mature sporophytes can persists
by their perennial and bifurcating rhizomes.


I wonder whether age of an individual close could be extrapolated by
trying to determine the size (diameter) of an individual clone and
taking into account its annual growth rate. Something like this has
been done for Osmunda regalis and Pteridium aquilinum, but I cannot
remember the references off-hand. I think one study on Pteridum
aquilinum was done by Park and Werth in 1993 near the Mt. Lake
Biological Station in Virginia.

Emily Burns, PhD (UC Santa Cruz, on the physiological influence of
climate on coast redwood forest plants_, currently Director of Science
at the Save the Redwoods League, and Research Associate in the
Pittermann lab at UCSC (see next blog post).

First of all, I’m really sorry to hear about the Polystichum munitum
die-off in your area. The drought of 2012-2015 has certainly taken its
toll on sword fern in California and the forests around Mt. Tamalpais
in the Bay Area experienced a similar crown die-back trend last
year. It seems that in our area, the stress brought on by the drought
caused the sword fern to be more susceptible to thrips, a small
blackish pest which discolors the leaves and can lead to foliage
decline. While many of the ferns appeared quite dead last year with
all of their leaves affected, with more rain they did send up new
fronds and appear to be recovering. I hope that a similar recovery is
possible for your local ferns. Starting in March (at least in CA),
ferns that are alive will begin to send up new leaves as fiddleheads
so keep a watch out for those.

We don’t know how old ferns can get, however their leaves are
considered evergreen and live for approximately 2.5 years with a
single cohort of leaves being produced each spring (meaning during the
summer, there are three ages of leaves on the crown and the oldest
leaves, usually on the outer perimeter of the crown, look like they
are beginning to decline and will die in the fall). In the case of a
forest fire or other disturbance that kills all the fronds, a new
cohort of leaves can flush and replace the crown.

<h4>Pittermann Lab, UC Santa Cruz</h4>

Fern drought research, described in a press release from the UCSC news
office: Study documents drought's impact on redwood forest ferns

The academic paper, from the New Phytologist, December 2015: Not dead
yet: the seasonal water relations of two perennial ferns during
California's exceptional drought

Especially of interest, from the summary:
 
The seasonal water relations of P. munitum and D. arguta are variable,
but consistent with laboratory-based estimates of drought
tolerance. Hydraulic and Ψ recovery following rain allows perennial
ferns to survive severe drought, but prolonged water deficit, coupled
with insect damage, may hamper frond survival. The legacy effects of
drought on reproductive capacity and community dynamics are unknown.

Another semi-popular extraction from the Pitterman et al research,
published here on the phys.org website: The native ferns that form a
lush green understory in coastal redwood forests are well adapted to
dry summers and periodic droughts, but California's current prolonged
drought has taken a toll on them. A comprehensive study of water
relations in native ferns, conducted during one of the worst droughts
in California's recent history, shows that extreme conditions have
tested the limits of drought tolerance in these plants.

"We've seen permanent dieback in some patches," said Jarmila
Pittermann, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at
UC Santa Cruz.

Pittermann's lab is studying ferns in the redwood forest on the UCSC
campus. Over a period of 15 months in 2013 and 2014, the researchers
closely monitored ferns at their study site, focusing on two common
species in the redwood forest understory: the western swordfern
(Polystichum munitum) and the coastal woodfern (Dryopteris arguta).

"These understory species are important in themselves, but also serve
as indicators of how climate change may affect our redwood forests,"
Pittermann said. "Considering that these plants are adapted to persist
through a typical summer dry season, the dieback emphasizes just how
unprecedented this drought has been over the past three years."

Her team collected data and samples at the study site every 10 days,
including measurements of soil moisture, leaf temperature, hydration
status of the plants, and how efficiently water moved through the
fronds. They also conducted greenhouse experiments and laboratory
tests.


The results, published in New Phytologist, show that the fronds of
these ferns can almost entirely lose the capacity to transport water
by the end of the dry season, yet they can recover within 24 hours
after a heavy rain. Despite this remarkable physiological resilience,
however, an extended drought limits the plants' ability to
photosynthesize and store energy. As a result, they may develop fewer
new leaves in the spring and be more vulnerable to insects and
diseases.

Ferns and other vascular plants transport water from roots to leaves
through a system of pipe-like conduits called xylem. When a plant
starts to experience water stress, its first response is to close the
pores in its leaves. This reduces water loss, but also blocks the
uptake of carbon dioxide needed for photosynthesis. Under extreme
water stress, the plant's hydraulic system starts to break down as air
bubbles form in the xylem, causing "embolisms" that block water
transport.

"We found that during the worst part of the drought in 2013, these
ferns had extensive embolisms that severely compromised the ability of
the xylem to conduct water," Pittermann said.

Although many plants would have a hard time recovering from this
condition, the native ferns were able to recover quickly after heavy
rains. Nevertheless, the extended periods of water stress during the
drought greatly reduced their ability to conduct photosynthesis and
perhaps their capacity to produce and store adequate levels of sugars
and other carbon compounds in their underground rhizomes, Pittermann
said.

"These plants are not accumulating enough carbon to support new growth
in the spring," she said. "The implications are that they may not make
enough spores to reproduce, and they may be more vulnerable to pests."

Pittermann and others have noticed an increase in infestations of
thrips, tiny insects that feed on plant sap, affecting ferns during
the drought. Other observers in Marin County have reported thrips
infestations and dieback of ferns in that area's redwood forests,
including popular tourist sites such as Muir Woods.

The new study is the first of its kind in ferns or understory plants
in general, and Pittermann has received funding from the Save the
Redwoods League to conduct further research. The redwood forest ferns
may be an important indicator of ecosystem change, she said, and
continued drought could lead to a very different type of understory
and might even threaten the redwoods themselves.  "Redwoods are not
deep-rooted trees, so an extended drought will eventually affect them
too," she said.

<h4>February 2017: Some Informal Weather Notes Related to the Sword Fern Die-off</4>

We sometimes speculate that recent drought and high temperatures,
particularly in the summer, may have caused, or may contribute to the
sword fern die-off.  The research presented in a blog post from
earlier today (from the Pittermann lab at UCSC) shows a strong
correlation, and plausible mechanisms for, sword fern die-back and the
California drought.  Perhaps our die-off is similar correlated to
weather?

Here I show some data which suggests that our precipitation levels are
well within normal Seattle ranges; indeed, they are higher than
average over all but one of the last seven years.  Month-by-month
reports show more variability, and three of the last six summers may
be somewhat unusally dry.  It will require more data to illuminate
that.

First, here is the 120 years of California PDSI (Palmer Drought
Severity Index - which combines precipitation and temperature data).
Following that are precipitation records (only) from Seattle, measured
at SeaTac Airport.  California's drought has been historically severe,
and quite anomalous.

<h4>February 2017:  Nitrogen Deficiency</h4>

The nitrogen deficiency hypothesis* gets some highly tentative support
from my work this week (March 4-11 2017).  “Not yet shown to be a dumb
idea” - that’s how I’d put it.  These results may justify followup
work: more samples in a good experimental design, rigorous sample
prep, laboratory assays by someone who really knows what they are
doing.

[*The hypothesis: by 200 years, a fir/hemlock/cedar forest needs a new
nitrogen source, with early succession nitrogen fixation exhausted.
Lobaria oregena is reported to perform this role in the Andrews
Experimental Forest; salmon (abetted by flooding and predation) in BC
and Alaska.  References on request.  Without lobaria - which is
reported to be sensitive to pollution - and in the absence of salmon
predation (no bears), the old-growth forest at Seward Park may be
experiencing a deficiency of available nitrogen.  Perhaps this is most
dire at Ground Zero.  Perhaps this weakened the sword ferns.  Perhaps
an opportunistic pest (phytophthora, thrips) gained a foothold.  Lots
of as-yet unsupported conjecture from me here.]

This time around, my third round of sampling, I: divided each vertical
6-inch soil core into four segments each ~1.5 inches in length dried
the samples for a week indoors at room temperature pulverized the dry
soil, creating fine soil particles used two positive controls: freshly
purchased potting soil, with and without nitrogen fertilizer added

<h4>New Sample Collection with Marianne Elliott, April 2017</h4>

Dr. Marianne Elliott returned to Seward Park on Tuesday April 4th to
collect a few dozen soil samples for subsequent phytophthora testing
at her lab at WSU Puyallup.  We collected from healthy, dead and
intermediate locations.  She also collected leachate samples prepared
by David George and me, twelve bags for six species of potted plants,
to further explore the possibility that Phytophora infection is being
introduced from native plant nurseries.

Marianne last visited the forest in November 2015.  She remarked on
the extent and severity of the sword fern die-off.

<h4>July 3 2017: Dan Hinkley's Mycelium Hypothesis</h4>

At risk of offering a suggestion that has more than likely already
been examined as obvious, the photos in your blog appear as if we
might be dealing with a mycelium complex in the soil that has made the
edaphic environment hydrophobic.

It appears as if nothing is regenerating, making it seem evident that
the pathogen is not conspecific to Polystichum but simply establishing
in Polystichum-friendly habitat.

Have any observations been made of fungal fruiting bodies on the outer
edge of the infection sites or have soil samples been examined for the
presence of mycelia?  This has the gestalt of a ‘fairy ring’ in a
lawn.  Has anyone attempted to mechanically aereate the Hatchery Creek
site to see if something will again begin to grow?  The dead zone can
seemingly only point to a hydrophobic condition, or to an unlikely
pathogen that kills everything in its wake and disallows anything to
reestablish.

<h4>June 2017 Soil Tests</h4>

Nelson Salisbury of EarthCorps, assisted by me, collected 10 samples each from three disparate 400 sq.ft. at Seward Park, following the protocol provided by the UMass Extension Service.  Here is a map and site summary, followed by lab reports for each site.
<ol>
  <li>Site #1 is ground zero - no surviving ferns.
  <li>Site #2 is just west, across the sqebeqsed trail, where ferns are currently dying.
  <li>Site #3 is at the north end, a healthy site, almost exclusively populated by ferns.

<h4>Feburary 2017</h4>

In February we planted three lines of young sword ferns, twelve ferns
in each line.  These ferns were part of our annual generous allotment
of three hundred restoration plants from Seattle Parks and the Green
Seattle Partnership.  They come from regional native plant nurseries;
the plants are about two years old.

Two of these lines are in the original ground zero at Seward Park, an
area that has been barren now for three years, with no natural
regeneration of any species.  The third line is about fifty yards
north and just outside of the current boundaries of active die-off.
Every fern was "watered-in".  Half of them - every other fern in each
line - were infused with mycorrhizal spores.

I hypothesize (based on evidence presented in the next blog post "A Lazarus Fern?") that the likely pathogen responsible for die-off has swept through ground zero and is no longer present.  Thus I predict that the two lines of twelve ferns in ground zero, if we water them through the first summer or two, will mostly survive.  As the die-off zone spreads it will soon encompass the northern line of twelve ferns.  I predict that most of these twelve ferns will die.    More specifically, and as a nod to statistical rigor, I predict a p-value < 0.05 when, after five years, we compare the survival rates at the two contrasting sizes, ground zero (24 ferns) and the northern line (12 ferns, aka AD for "active die-off).  Here this is mocked up in a little R code:


set.seed(17)
GZ <- as.integer(runif(24) + 0.7)       #   75% survival: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1  
                                                           #                           1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 
AD <- as.integer(runif(12) + 0.25)    #   25% survival: 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
t.test(GZ, AD)$p.value                      #   0.0047


I photograph all thirty-six ferns every week and will create a
time-lapse video for each fern as these weekly photos accumulate.  The
two GZ lines are shown in the picture above.

<h4> March 2017: a Lazarus Fern</h4>

When I returned to Ground Zero a week after the two lines of twelve
ferns were planted, in order to take the first set of time-lapse
photos, I was shocked and delighted to discover a healthy fern which
had not been planted by us.  Since sword ferns, we are told, will not
reproduce under a closed forest canopy, I assume that this fern has
come back from the dead: enough life lingered in the rhizome for it to
regrow after three years of inactivity.  Hence: the Lazarus Fern.
Definitive evidence for this claim - of regrowth rather than new
growth - could come from removing soil and locating (or not locating)
a large rhizome; young ferns do not acquire a rhizome for at least
five years.  I do not want to disturb this rare, resuscitated, old
survivor - or is it a new young plant? - not yet.


<h4>March 2018: Earthworm Hypothesis</h4>

Astute reader Betsy Dowling, a Seattle native now studying urban
horticulture at Mesa Community College in Arizona, noticed the
similarity between the Seward Park 2011-2017 before and after photos
which introduce this blog, and this pair, from the 5th edition of Soil
Science and Management, Edward Plaster, 2008 - copied here (alas)

On a quick trip to Seward Park last night I performed a ridiculously
ad hoc assay, digging and examining a cubic foot of soil from three
spots: ground zero (GZ: 1 worm), active die-off zone (ADZ: 4 worms)
and a healthy dense sword fern community off the Erratic Trail (ET: 4
worms).  This establishes nothing other than that earthworms (no
species ID) are present.

Here is a hodgepodge of academic papers.  2002 research by Michael
Gundale apparently introduced the topic, describing on the effects of
invasive earthworms on a rare, mostly underground fern: Influence of
Exotic Earthworms on the Soil Organic Horizon and the Rare Fern
Botrychium mormo The research is summarized in the Conservation
Magazine.  The original paper is listed here, with this abstract:

Forests north of the last glacial extent have no native
earthworms. Exotic earthworms are now colonizing forests that are
naturally free of earthworms. It is currently unknown how these exotic
earthworms might affect rare plants. To determine whether there is an
association between the presence of an exotic earthworm species and
extirpation of the rare fern Botrychium mormo, I surveyed 28
populations documented and counted previously. I estimated current
population sizes of B. mormo, soil horizon thickness, earthworm
species present, and carbon content, nitrogen content, and pH of the A
soil horizon. Two earthworm species were abundant, Lumbricus rubellus
and Dendrobaena octaedra. Dendrobaena octaedra had no significant
association with any soil variable or with B. mormo
extirpation. Lumbricus rubellus was significantly associated with
B. mormo extirpation and a mull humus type. Where L. rubellus was
present, O1 and O2 horizons were significantly thinner. I conducted a
laboratory microcosm experiment to determine whether L. rubellus could
create the conditions it was associated with in the field. Microcosms
with L. rubellus resulted in a significant reduction in the thickness
of the O1 and O2 horizon and a significant increase in the thickness
of the A horizon. This experiment suggests that L. rubellus created
the conditions with which it was associated in the field. The
intrinsic rate of increase (r) of B. mormo was best explained by the
O2 depth, which implies that this soil layer supplies a critical
resource. My results support the idea that exotic earthworms alter the
forest floor, leading to negative changes in native vegetation.


<h4>July 2018</h4>

Following the suggestion of Betsy Dowling of Zanzibar Landscape Design (Betsy contributed the earthworm hypothesis a few months ago) I today found and photographed ten barely resurgent ferns, at Ground Zero and to the south.   I will add these to my weekly rephotography round.  Perhaps some will survive the summer drought.

In this region there are perhaps 500 or 1000 dead crowns, like the one pictured below - a state they reach  roughly  two years after die-off.   The appearance of these few sprouting fronds might be explained by, or at least is consistent with, this model:


The die-off is an epidemic event: a widespread occurrence at a
particular time

Some individuals (~2%?) though severely affected, previously judged
dead, remain vital, making new small fronds, late in the season,
several years after the initial infection.  That this spring has been
long-lived, cool and with some rain, may contribute to this
phenomenon.  I have noticed only a very few of these tiny sprouts in
past years.

The hypothetical infection may be cyclical.  Weak support for that
possibility is provided by old stubbled fern crowns to the south of
Ground Zero which we estimate (without metrics or dependable assays)
to be from about 20 years ago.



<h4>September 2018: the beer bottle experiment</h4>

A small and informal experiment suggests that the agent/s of the
die-off can be reproducibly transmitted from an affected frond to a
healthy one
