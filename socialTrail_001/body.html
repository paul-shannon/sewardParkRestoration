<h3 style="margin-top: 20px"> Social Trail #001 </h3>

<div style="margin-right: 100px;">
This trail may have been present for a few years, but became
especially obvious in June 2020.  It runs east from the sqebeqsed for
a couple of hundred feet.

<p>
Our plan is to close the trail at its entrance with a big obstacle
woven of branches, brush and CWD, leaving the interior of the trail to recover on its own,
tracking progress here.
