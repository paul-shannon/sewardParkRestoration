<h3 style="margin-top: 20px"> Social Trail #001 </h3>

<div style="margin-right: 100px;">
This trail may have been present for a few years, but became
especially obvious in June 2020.  It runs east from the sqebeqsed for
a couple of hundred feet.

<p>
Our plan is to close the trail at its entrance with a big obstacle
woven of branches, brush and CWD, leaving the interior of the trail to recover on its own,
tracking progress here.

<h3>After closing, as seen from the sqebeqsed trail</h3>
<p>
A madrone tree fell nearby, apparently sometime in the last year,
providing a supply of branches, large and small, to create a barrier
and discourage use of the trail.
