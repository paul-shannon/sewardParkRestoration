<h3 style="margin-top: 20px;"> Site introduction </h3>

A multi-rooted, hollow Bigleaf Maple stands at a corner of the Woodpecker
Trail.  Its shape beguiles - children are drawn to it, and over the years
it has hosted playing, running kids.  In this it is like the Fairy
Tree.
<p>
And like the Fairy Tree, this tree invites overuse - well-intentioned,
and exuberant, but nonetheless harmful and destructive.
<p>
Bare ground in a Pacific Northwest forest is dead ground.  As it
compacts and expands from foot traffic, the fabric of the forest
ecosystem grows weak.

<h3>Bare Ground Behind</h3>
This photo captures the expanse of bare ground behind the maple, as
seen from a little further east on the trail.  A bit of the maple is
visible on the right, and a cedar is on the left.

<h3>A Collection of Sticks</h3>
On first encounter, and perhaps second, one sees here a playful collection of
sticks artfully arranged on the maple tree.  Another perspective,
however, is worth considering.  To gather  wood from a fragile forest, no
matter how small the sticks, no matter how pleasing the result, no
matter how much we admire kids creativity, we think this is not the
place.  Here, in this already overused site, in an increasingly
threatened forest, we - reluctantly - view this as yet another
instance of disruption of and damage to the ecology of this site.  
<p>

<i>(Note that ten years ago the Friends of Seward Park, recognizing
  that kids connect to the forest through DOING,  lobbied hard for a
"rough use" set aside second growth forest nearby at Seward Park,
where kids could play and jump, dig and build in the forest,  We
failed to persuade.  )</i>

  dimensions:  about 50' north to south, and 20' east to west,
  shape: roughly  rectangular, also wrapping around the maple tree.
  area: ~1000 sq ft
  total volume at 0.5' coverage: 500 cu ft
  mulch: 500/27 = 18 yards of mulch

<p> We will need some minimal effective barriers,
  allowing for some run-around room right around the tree.
