<p> The venerable Western Hemlock - Washington's state tree - has been
in decline in the Puget Lowlands since 2015. The trees are dying - not everywhere
at at once, but intermittently, often in clusters, throughout low elevations west of the
Cascades.
<p>
Researchers initially attributed the mortality to
<i>Rhizoctonia butini</i>, a fungus in the order Cantharellales.  This
hypothesis has since fallen out of favor (Jared LeBoldus, OSU
Corvallis, personal communication).  No subsequent explanation has
emerged.

<p>
We frequently hear this mortality attributed to normal old age senescence, or climate change.

<p>We are not so sure.  Casual observation in Seward Park's 120-acre
old-growth urban forest suggested that age and climate did not
explain hemlock mortality, in that we see areas with many dead trees, and we see
many more areas dense with healthy trees.  A mix of tree ages is found
in both kinds of sites.  We can assume that climate and weather patterns are
constant across this small forest.  

<p>  If the observed contrast holds up, and if the population of
trees in the two contrasting areas are otherwise identical - by age,
density, and site characteristics - then we have an ideal site for
studying the regional decline.  Seward provides a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment" target="_blank">natural experiment</a>.


### Students Mapped, Measured and Assessed 724 Hemlock Trees

Between January and March, two Univeristy of Washington students from
the Program on the Environment in their senior Capstone Research Project,
along with a Garfield High School junior spent about nine weeks in the
forest, collecting data to test our hypothesis.

We also used data collected in the summer of 2021 by CHOOSE 180 interns.



<p> Our citizen and student science sets the stage for in-depth
research.   These are the steps we have taken:


<ol>
  <li> We initially identified a two acre healthy site (the "hemlock garden") to compare
    to the six acre affected site (the "hemlock graveyard")
  <li> We mapped, measured and assessed the health of all trees in these two sites
  <li> We found that these two sites, separated within continuous forest by 700 meters,
        were identical except for mortality: same size distribution,
        weather patterns, and soil type.
  <li> We next expanded our survey to include 724 total hemlocks across most of the 120-acre forest
  <li> Analysis (significance tests and kernel density calculations, shown below) establish that
   the hemlock graveyard is a significant outlier with respect to  hemlock mortality in this forest.
</ol>


```{r setup, include = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
f <- "https://pshannon.net/hemlockSurvey2024/tblFinal.csv"
tbl <- read.table(f, sep=",", header=TRUE, as.is=TRUE, nrow=-1, quote="")
#dim(tbl)
```

### Initial Evidence From Small Sites: "Graveyard" and "Garden"


We started, as mentioned above, with all the trees in two dense hemlock sites.
Preliminary statistics confirmed our intuition, as these boxplots show.


<p> Subsequent mapping and analysis refined these results - see below.

```{r boxplots, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

tbl.graveyard <- subset(tbl, lat >= 47.558934)
tbl.garden    <- subset(tbl, lat <= 47.555554)
boxplot(tbl.graveyard$h, tbl.garden$h, names=c("graveyard", "garden"), main="Hemlock Health scaled 0-3")
boxplot(tbl.graveyard$dbh, tbl.garden$dbh, names=c("graveyard", "garden"),
         main="Hemlock Diameter (DBH inches) a proxy for age")


```

<p> We soon realized the importance of broadening our study.  Here is a screenshot of
our efforts at an intermediate stage, the blue circles marking the garden and
graveyard, with many additional trees added. 

<p>In subsequent work, shown below, the blue, visually estimated boundaries are replaced
by analytical boundaries calculated by kernel density methods.

### Density Maps:  All Hemlocks; dying and dead; healthh hemlocks

"Overplotting" - the display of abundant overlapping points - makes it
hard (quite literally), to see the forest for the trees.  We see
this in the map above, and in the final interactive version
available <a href="https://pshannon.net/hemlockSurvey2024"
target="_blank">here</a>.  Kernel density mapping solves the problem:
large patterns to emerge. These three panels below do this, showing
the concentration of all (left), of affected (middle) and of healthy
(left) hemlocks across the forest.

```{r densityMaps, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
   knitr::include_graphics("hemlockHealthDensityMaps.png")
```

### Selecting Contrasting Candidate Sites for Further Study

These three density maps confirm our informal observation, and hypothesis,
that  contrasting health and Seward's version of hemlock decline is not
straightforwardly explained by senesence or weather patterns.

<p>
To strengthen our case, we defined two contiguous regions with

<ol>
   <li> similar density of hemlocks
   <li> contrasting health status
</ol>

Our method:
<ol>
   <li> subset the full observation table by health
   <li> calculate kernel densities of hemlocks in both groups
   <li> from these densities, identify the boundaries of comparable sites 
</ol>

```{r densityContours, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
library(MASS)
library(RColorBrewer)
options(digits=12)


f <- "https://pshannon.net/hemlockSurvey2024/tblFinal.csv"
tbl <- read.table(f, sep=",", header=TRUE, as.is=TRUE, nrow=-1, quote="")
     # get just the healthy trees
tbl.x <- subset(tbl, h>=2) 
min.density <- 30000
cellCount <- 500
osm.limits <- c(-122.25676, -122.248006, 47.548233, 47.562744) # open street map
limits <- osm.limits

f.healthy <- kde2d(tbl.x$lon, tbl.x$lat, n=cellCount, lims=limits)
z <- f.healthy$z
     # zero out low density cells
z[z <min.density] <- 0
f.healthy$z <- z
     # display if you wish

healthy.colors <- brewer.pal(8, "Greens")
healthy.colors[1] <- "#FFFFFF"
sick.colors <- brewer.pal(8, "Reds")
sick.colors[1] <- "#FFFFFF"

# image(f.healthy, main="healthy", col=healthy.colors) #, zlim = c(0, 0.05))

      # can we get the boundary of the highest density region
      # from the contour?

tbl.x <- subset(tbl, h<=1)
f.sick <- kde2d(tbl.x$lon, tbl.x$lat, n=cellCount, lims=limits)
z <- f.sick$z
z[z <min.density] <- NA
f.sick$z <- z
range(f.sick$z)
#pdf("sick.pdf")
#image(f.sick, main="sick", add=FALSE, col=sick.colors)
boundaries.sick <- contourLines(f.sick)
boundaries.healthy <- contourLines(f.healthy)
#print(as.numeric(unlist(lapply(boundaries.sick, "[", "level"))))
#print(length(boundaries.sick[[6]]$x))
#print(as.numeric(unlist(lapply(boundaries.healthy, "[", "level"))))
#print(length(boundaries.healthy[[6]]$x))
# x <- boundaries.sick[[6]]$x
# y <- boundaries.sick[[6]]$y
# for(i in seq_len(length(x))){
#   print(sprintf("{lat: %12.8f, lng: %12.8f},", y[i], x[i]))
#   }

# x <- boundaries.healthy[[6]]$x
# y <- boundaries.healthy[[6]]$y
# for(i in seq_len(length(x))){
#   print(sprintf("{lat: %12.8f, lng: %12.8f},", y[i], x[i]))
#   }

```
### Density-derived Boundaries for Hemlock Graveyard and Garden

Here you can see that healthy hemlocks are dense thoughout the central and
southern regions of the forest, in an area that includes, but extends far beyong our original
"hemlock garden" site.
<p>

```{r densityGraveyardAndGardenMap, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
   knitr::include_graphics("hemlockMapWithDensity.png")
```

#### Conclusion

Our citizen and student science establishes that in Seward Park's old-growth forest,
hemlock die-off is dramatic; is not caused simply by senescence or weather patterns,
and that it provides an opportunity for further (professional) study.
<p>
We predict that foliar and mycorrhizal DNA sequencing, entomological studies,
and root rot analyses may all be needed to understand this problem.  Once understood,
remedies may become possible.
