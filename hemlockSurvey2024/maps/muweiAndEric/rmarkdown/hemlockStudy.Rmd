### Western Hemlock mortality reported throughout the Puget lowlands since at least 2015.


Researchers initially believed that this unusual mortality was caused
by <i>Rhizoctonia butini</i>, a fungus in the order Cantharellales.
This mechanism has since lost favor (personal communication, Jared
LeBoldus, OSU Corvallis, personal communication), but no replacement
theory has arisen.

<p>
Scientists and citizens commonly suggest that the mortality is due
simply to old age - normal senescence - due to changes in weather patterns
due to climate change.   

<p> We suggest that neither hypothesis fits our data, and that the
search for the causes of hemlock decline should continue.

<p>Seward Park's remnant old-growth urban forest, 120 acres on a peninsula
in Lake Washington, offers the opportunity to study this problem.   This
forest has in the neighborhood of 800 Western Hemlock trees, of all ages, from
newborn seedlings to four foot diameter 250 year old giants.

<p> Informal observation led forest steward Paul Shannon to suppose that
Two small (hectare-sized) hemlock-rich sites at Seward have
roughly equivalent age and density distributions, yet radically
different health profiles.  These contrasting sites offer the
opportunity to study contrasting health and disease, and perhaps to
identify the mechanism of the regional hemlock decline, where
confounding factors are eliminated:  age distributions are similar,
weather patterns are identical, mortality is radically diffeent.

<p> In the study reported here, we followed up on Shannon's informal
observations by measuring hundreds of hemlocks of all sizes, ages, locations and
health status.  This set the stage for tests of statistical signifcance shown
below.


```{r setup, include = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
f <- "https://pshannon.net/hemlockSurvey2024/tblFinal.csv"
tbl <- read.table(f, sep=",", header=TRUE, as.is=TRUE, nrow=-1, quote="")
#dim(tbl)
```
### "Graveyard" and "Garden"

These two dense hemlock sites, initially identified by informal
inspection, have comparable age distribution - estimated from tree diameter -
and contasting health.

<p> Subsequent mapping and analysis refined these results - see below.

```{r boxplots, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

tbl.graveyard <- subset(tbl, lat >= 47.558934)
tbl.garden    <- subset(tbl, lat <= 47.555554)
boxplot(tbl.graveyard$h, tbl.garden$h, names=c("graveyard", "garden"), main="Hemlock Health scaled 0-3")
boxplot(tbl.graveyard$dbh, tbl.garden$dbh, names=c("graveyard", "garden"),
         main="Hemlock Diameter (DBH inches) a proxy for age")


```

### Students Mapped, Measured and Assessed 600 Hemlock Trees

Between January and March, two Univeristy of Washington students from
the Program on the Environment, in their senior Capstone Research Project,
along with a Garfield High School junior, spent about 200 hours in the
forest, collecting data to test the hypothesis that

<ol>
   <li> dense hemlock stands
   <li> of similar age distrituion
   <li> exposed to essentially identical weather patterns
   <li> nonethess exhibed sharply contrasting health
   <li> thereby complicating popular notions that hemlock decline is due to
     <ul>
        <li> normal senescence
        <li> changing weather patterns associated with climate change
     </ul>
</ol>

<p>
Here is a screenshot of the resulting <a href="https://pshannon.net/hemlockSurvey2024" target="_blank">interactive map</a>.
The blue circles are hand-drawn visual estimates of the boundaries of the two informally
identified contrasting sites.   These are replace below by analytically derived
boundaries.

### Density Maps:  All Hemlocks, dying and dead, health hemlocks

Kernel Density solves the "overplotting" problem seen in the map above, in
which the regional state of the forest is obscured by the large number of
individulally measures trees.   The leftmost plot shows the density of
all hemlocks.  The middle shows the density of dead and low health trees.
The rightmost plot shows the distribution of healthy hemlocks.

```{r densityMaps, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

```

### Selecting Contrasting Candidate Sites for Further Study

In the density maps above, middle and left, we have confirmation of
our informal observation, that sites of contrasting health are
geographically separated.
<p>
Out next step is to define two sites of
<ol>
   <li> similar size
   <li> similar density of hemlocks
   <li> contrasting health status
</ol>

Our method:
<ol>
   <li> subset the full observation table by latitude and longitude
   <li> poor health: trees northwest of 47.558711, -122.250358
   <li> good health: trees south and east of that point
   <li> calculate kernel densities of hemlocks in both regions
   <li> from these densities, identify the boundaries of comparable sites 
</ol>
