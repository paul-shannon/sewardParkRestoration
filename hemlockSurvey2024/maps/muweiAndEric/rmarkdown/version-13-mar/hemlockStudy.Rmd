<p> The venerable Western Hemlock - Washington's state tree - has been
in decline in the Puget Lowlands since at least 2015. These trees are
dying - not everywhere all at once - as with HWA and the Eastern
Hemlock - but intermittently, often in clusters throughout low
elevations west of the Cascades.  This upsurge in mortality 
is a departure from normal hemlock population dynamics, and from the
historical intermittent effects of endemic fungal diseases.

<p> By 2017, researchers were attributing the mortality to <i>Rhizoctonia
butini</i>, a fungus in the order Cantharellales.  This hypothesis has
since been abandoned (according to personal communications from
Jared LeBoldus, OSU Corvallis, and Kevin Zobrist, WSU).  No new  explanation has
emerged, but we often hear the suggestion that the mortality is due to
normal old age or climate change.

<p>

Our informal observations in Seward Park's 120-acre
old-growth urban forest lead us to suggest otherwise.  We see  many
dead trees, young and old, mostly concentrated in six acres in the northern
forest.  We have watched these trees die.  We watch as this dead zone spreads.

<p>
Yet we also see many healthy hemlocks in the forest.
We see trees of all ages, from young saplings to 250 year old giants.
We see only intermittent normal mortality.

<p> So we suspect that other causes are at play in the dead
zone. Only comprehensive data and good statistics can turn that suspicion
into robust scientific findings.  So four of us spent nine weeks
mapping, measuring and assessing the health of 724 Western Hemlocks in
Seward Park's forest.

<p>
We establish that neither climate nor normal
senesence is killing the hemlocks.  We establish the need for further
research to figure out the mechanisms of mortality - for the benefit
of Seward's old-growth forest, and for forests throughout the
region.

<p>

We further propose that Seward's forest provides <b>an ideal site for a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment"
target="_blank">natural experiment</a></b>, an excellent opportunity for deeper
research into the mechanisms of Puget Lowland Western Hemlock decline.

### Mapping and  Measuring at Seward Park

Between January and March, two Univeristy of Washington students from
the Program on the Environment in their senior Capstone Research Project,
along with a Garfield High School junior, and Seward's Green Seattle
Partnership forest steward, guided by Dr. Tim Billo of the UW,
spent  nine weeks in the
forest collecting data to test our hypothesis.  The study participants
are listed in Appendix B, below.

We also used data collected in the summer of 2021 by CHOOSE 180 interns.

We took these steps in the study:

<ol>
  <li> We initially identified a two acre healthy site (the "hemlock garden") and
      a six acre affected site (the "hemlock graveyard"). This site has been
      expanding slowly over the last five years.
  <li> We mapped, measured and assessed the health of all trees in these two sites.
  <li> We found that the two sites, separated within continuous old-growth forest by 700 meters,
        were identical except for mortality: they have the same size distribution,
        see the same weather patterns, and have the same type of soil.
  <li> We next expanded our survey to include 724 total hemlocks across most
      of the 120-acre forest.
</ol>


```{r setup, include = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
f <- "https://pshannon.net/hemlockSurvey2024/tblFinal.csv"
tbl <- read.table(f, sep=",", header=TRUE, as.is=TRUE, nrow=-1, quote="")
```

### Our Results
<br>

```{r finalMap, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
   knitr::include_graphics("hemlockMapFinal.png")
```

<i>(An interactive version of the above map, along with the full dataset, is available
<a href="https://pshannon.net/hemlockSurvey2024/" target="_blank">here</a>.)</i>

After mapping, measuring, and assessing the health of 724 trees across a broad
swath of the 120-acre forest, skipping over regions with few or no
hemlocks, we partitioned the trees into those with good-to-excellent
health (greater than 2 on a 0-3 scale, see Appendix C), and those with
poor health (less than 1 on that same scale).

<p> This mapping, and subsequent density calculations, allowed us to
confirm the hemlock graveyard, and to define the "extended garden", which
is much larger than our originally identified two acre healthy site.  We see
sick and dying trees are heavily concentrated in a contiguous region
in the north of the forest.  Healthy hemlocks are found south, central
and east throughout the forest.

<p>
We establish that the hemlock graveyard is a
highly significant outlier with respect to hemlock mortality in this forest.  And
we lay to rest claims that the mortality is due only to climate change or
normal senescence.

<p>


### The Climate Change Claim

This is easily dispensed with.  Or, at least, reduced to a minor role.   The two regions
<i>may</i> have significant micro-climate differences, or micro-site
characteristics which contribute to differential mortality.  But it is unlikely
that decade-scale climate change phenomena, showing up as significant
differences in micro-scale weather patterns, will explain the radical
mortality difference of the two regions, graveyard and garden.

### The Natural Senescence Claim

Here we show that big old trees are roughly equally represented
in the two regions, but that the health of those trees is dramatically different.
(See Appendix A, below, explainiing omission of younger trees.)
<p>

```{r boxplots, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
dbh.threshold <- 15
boxplot(subset(tbl, loc=="graveyard" & dbh > dbh.threshold)$dbh,
        subset(tbl, loc=="garden" & dbh > dbh.threshold)$dbh,
        main="Tree Diameter (a proxy for age; youngest trees omitted)",
        names=c("Graveyard", "Garden"))

boxplot(subset(tbl, loc=="graveyard" & dbh > dbh.threshold)$h,
        subset(tbl, loc=="garden" & dbh > dbh.threshold)$h,
        main="Health (youngest trees omitted)",
        names=c("Graveyard", "Garden"))
```

### Significance Tests

The Student's t-Test complements these boxplots, attaching a number value to
the contrasts shown in the boxplots.
<p>
With respect to tree size (which roughly correlates with tree age) the two sites
have the same distribution.   A p.value of larger that 0.7 attests that these
groups are highly similar.

```{r significanceTests.dbh, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

dbh.threshold <- 15
garden.bigTrees.dbh <- subset(tbl, loc=="garden" & dbh > dbh.threshold)$dbh
graveyard.bigTrees.dbh <- subset(tbl, loc=="graveyard" & dbh > dbh.threshold)$dbh

t.test(graveyard.bigTrees.dbh, garden.bigTrees.dbh)$p.value
```

This p.value, less than l0e-15, indicates that the contrast in hemlock
health across the two regions is highly significant: the difference
is real, and not due to random variation.

This statistically robust contrast is our major finding.

```{r significanceTests.health, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
garden.bigTrees.health <- subset(tbl, loc=="garden" & dbh > dbh.threshold)$h
graveyard.bigTrees.health <- subset(tbl, loc=="graveyard" & dbh > dbh.threshold)$h

t.test(graveyard.bigTrees.health, garden.bigTrees.health)$p.value
```
<br><br><br>


#### Conclusion

<br>
Our nine-week citizen and student science study establishes that
<ol>
  <li> Seward Park's old-growth forest hemlock die-off is dramatic and
  concentrated in one (expanding) six acre region.
  <li> is not caused simply by senescence or weather patterns,
  <li> that it provides an opportunity for further (professional) study.
</ol>


We predict that foliar and mycorrhizal DNA sequencing, entomological studies,
and root rot analyses may all be needed to understand this problem.  Once understood,
remedies may be found, further decline and symptom spread may be prevented.
<p>
<br>
We offer one caveat in closing.  Our past visits to other affected sites suggested
to us that Seward mortality, and regional mortality, are the same phenomenon.
But in this study we did not collect observations at other
sites.  Therefore we have not yet established that 
Seward's hemlock mortality, and that of the region, are identical.  Detailed
field observations are needed, perhaps laboratory and molecular methods as well.

### Appendix A: Filtering Trees by Size Before Comparing Health
<p>
When addressing the claim that hemlocks at Seward are dying because of
old age - that is, due to normal Puget Lowland hemlock senescence - we above
filtered out all trees less than 10 inches diameter at breast height, <b>dhb</b>.

<p>
We motivate and justify this filtering here.
<p>
First, let us examime  the relative ages of graveyard trees and garden trees. 


```{r ageHistograms, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
hist(subset(tbl, loc=="garden")$dbh, main="Garden DBH", xlab="inches", xlim=c(0,60), ylim=c(0,120))
hist(subset(tbl, loc=="graveyard")$dbh, main="Graveyard DBH", xlab="inches", xlim=c(0,60), ylim=c(0,120))
```
<p>

We see that there is an abundance of small diameter hemlocks in the
garden, and comparitively few in the graveyard.  If we compare all
sizes (all ages) in both groups, we will see that, and be misled by,
their being approximately equal distribution in the graveyard across
all sizes.

<p> (Two explanations for the paucity of young trees in the graveyard occur to us;
there may be others.   First, that this region is no longer conducive to hemlock
growth for trees of any age, including seedlings and saplings.  Second, the
heavy mortality of larger trees may have lead to diminished seed source in
recent years.)


```{r unfilteredAgeBoxplots, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
boxplot(subset(tbl, loc=="graveyard")$dbh,
           subset(tbl, loc=="garden")$dbh,
        main="DBH (a proxy for age; all trees included)",
        names=c("Graveyard", "Garden"))
```
<p>
In this view, the distribution of trees in the graveyard - all trees - is
somewhat larger.
<p>
However, this boxplot does not answer the question we are actually asking
in this study:  are hemlocks dying due to old age?  We can
best answer this by comparing the health of large trees in the two
populations: apples to apples, big (old) trees to big (old) trees.
<p>
We can see that the distribution of older trees is
roughly similar in the two groups:

```{r filteredAgeBoxplots, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
boxplot(subset(tbl, loc=="graveyard" & dbh >= 15)$dbh,
        subset(tbl, loc=="garden" & dbh >= 15)$dbh,
        main="DBH (a proxy for age; larger trees only)",
        names=c("Graveyard", "Garden"))
```
<p>
With a cutoff of 15 inches dbh, we have comparable populations.

<p>
Now let's compare their health.

```{r filteredhealthBoxplots, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
boxplot(subset(tbl, loc=="graveyard" & dbh >= 15)$h,
        subset(tbl, loc=="garden" & dbh >= 15)$h,
        main="Health - larger trees only",
        names=c("Graveyard", "Garden"))
```
<p>
And obtain their t.test pvalue, which estimates the likelihood
that the population difference could occur by chance.

```{r filteredHealthttest, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
t.test(subset(tbl, loc=="graveyard" & dbh >= 15)$h,
       subset(tbl, loc=="garden" & dbh >= 15)$h)$p.value

```

### Appendix C: Hemlock Health Assessment

<br>

We adapted aspects of the DMR (Dwarf Mistletoe Rating) system,
originally suggested to us by Marianne Elliott in 2021.  Our proxy
for health was an informal estimate of the robustness and extent of
needles on each third of the tree.

<p> In our scheme, <b>h1</b> is
the bottom third of the tree, <b>h2</b> is the middle third, and
<b>h3</b> the top.  Each section received a number on a scale of 0 (no
remaining needles) to 3 (abundant needles, no significant bare
branches).
<p>

<p>
We learned early in the project that mature hemlocks, especially those
which are in the canopy exposed to direct sun, self-prune their lower
branches. In these cases we assigned the value <b>NA</b> to the lower
thirds of the tree, so that the tree's evolved response to canopy
status is not counted as ill-health.

<p>
For each tree, we calculate a composite score, the average of
the three section scores.

<p> These ratings, and indeed the informal division of
each tree’s trunk into thirds, are imprecise. Nonetheless, after the
first few days in the field, all four of us easily reached consensus
on each tree that we encountered, suggesting that these informal
ratings can be easily reproduced by independent observers.


<p>
Understory trees usually fit the original model, in which bare, needle-sparese or recently
fallen lower branches are a sign of ill-health.
<p>
Perhaps the best description of our method is that we assign grades of ill-health
based on the evidence of failing needles, branchlets and branches where,
according to healthy Western Hemlock needle and branch patterns, we
expect them to flourish.  In essence, our method was a consensus arising from
negotiation of four 'human <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.4487" target="_blank">phenocams'</a>.

### Appendix D: Kernel Density Calculations

<br>

Here, for those interested, and providing a basis for re-analysis of the data,
is the R code which
<ul>
   <li> partitions the trees into sick and healthy subsets
   <li> calculates density plots for each subset
   <li> saves selected contours for import into the interactive map
   <li> assigns each tree in the data set into one of three groups:  garden, graveyard, none

### Appendix E: Estimating the Age of Healthy Hemlocks in the Garden

In a 1983 journal article, Mark Harmon and Jerry Franklin offer a linear
model relating Western Hemlock age in years to diameter in centimeters:

<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
<a href="https://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/lter/pubs/pdf/pub214.pdf"
target="_blank">Age Distribution of Western Hemlock and Its Relation to
Roosevelt Elk Populations in the South Fork
Hoh River Valley, Washington</a>
</div>

<img src="hemlockAgeDbhFormula-franklin.png" width=800>

Their model comes from direct measurment, of diameter at breast height, and
of tree age by counting rings after increment boring.  If we apply their
formula, while acknowledging that the Hoh River Valley receives four times as
much rain as Seward Park, we find this profile of tree age.

```{r treeAge, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
dbh <- subset(tbl, loc=="garden" & h > 2.5)$dbh
dbh.cm <- 2.54 * dbh
age <- round(30.5 + (1.8 * dbh.cm))
hist(age, main="Estimaged Age\n for 185 Healthy Hemlock Garden trees", xlab="years",
     xlim=c(0,300))
```

The fire history of Seward's forest may be relevant here.  We believe that a stand
replacement fire swept the peninsula about 1500.  A more moderate fire
burned through about 1720, survived by about 100 firs and a dozen cedars.  Our
oldest hemlocks may have seeded in within fify years of the more recent fire,
as the surving douglas firs, and younger trees (maples? cedars?) formed a new
canopy. [This fire history is drawn from diverse sources and is somewhat conjectural.]
