<h1 class="center">A Proposal to Assess Western Hemlock Health Status <br>in Two
  Contrasting Sites in the Old-Growth Forest at Seward Park</h1>

  </div>

<div class="basic">
 Since 2015, there have been
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hemlock+decline+washington+pnw"
  target="_blank">intermittent reports</a> of Western Hemlock (<i>Tsuga
	 heterophylla</i>) decline and mortality in the
  <a href="http://www.landscope.org/washington/natural_geography/ecoregions/puget_trough/"
  target="_blank">Puget Trough</a>.  A variety of causes have been
  suggested, but none established.  These include:  normal senescence,
  heat and/or drought effects,
  foliar disease caused by Rhizoctonia butinii,  newly virulent Annosus root disease
  affecting the whole tree, even the Eastern Hemlock's Wooly Adelgid.  We have
  been unable to find any peer-reviewed publications addressing this problem.

  <p> In a
	 preliminary <a href="https://pshannon.net/nextSteps/hemlockSurvey-finalReport-nov2021.pdf"
	 target="_blank">2021 study</a>, we found that decline and
	 mortality were unevenly distributed across the Seward Park
	 peninsula: it is most pronounced in the north central region of the
	 forest.  With the passage of two years, the mortality in that
	 region, across two hectares is now nearly total, and continuing to
	 spread: nearly all trees in that region (see map below) are diseased or dead.

	 <p> We recently discovered a one hectare, hemlock-rich region in the
	  southeastern portion of Seward's forest.  Here we see - in
	  informal inspection -  a similar
	  density and age distribution of hemlocks - from sapling to &gt;
		200 years - but, by contrast, nearly all of the hemlocks appear
	  to be in excellent health.

	<p> With guidance from UW's  Dr. Tim Billo, and review by the
	Seward Park Forest Health Scientific Advisory Board (here
	solicited) we propose to locate, measure, and assess the health of
	every Western Hemlock in these two regions.   Three Capstone
	Research students from the UW's Program on the Environment,
	joined by Forest Steward Paul Shannon, will carry out this work
   during January, February and March of 2024.

	<p> Our goal is to establish via precise counts and a reproducible
	health assay protocol that these two regions do indeed exhibit
	radically different health profiles.  We suggest this contrast
	will provide the opportunity for followup studies on disease causality.  Many
	common confouding environmental factors (rainfall,
	temperature, elevation, air quality) are reduced by the sites'
	propinquity: they are separated by less than 700 meters.

<h3 class="center"> Some Aspects of the Survey Protocol</h3>	  

<div class="basic">
  
<ol>
   <li> latitude, longitude & DBH will be measured for every tree
   <li> Individual tree health will be assessed with a modified <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5187427.pdf" target="_blank">DMR</a>
     protocol (suggested to us by Dr. Marianne Elliot in 2021, and
     used in that year's study):
	  <ul>
		 <li> Four category scale, 0-3, will describe branch health in
		 each vertical third of the tree, with low scores assigned where
		 branch ill-health is obseved.
   	 <li> Clear indicators of ill-health will be our primary measure
		 <li> Hemlocks shed lower branches when
		 they emerge from understory to canopy: these taller trees will not be
		 penalized for lacking healthy branches in their lower two
 		thirds.
		 <li> Healthy understory hemlocks sometimes shed some branches,
		 favoring those exposed to sunlight.  This, too, will enter into
			category assignment.
		<li> High canopy foliage is visibly disrupted in dying trees:
		sparse needles, drooping branhlets, an excess of cones
		 <li> To ensure uniformity and reproducibility, exemplary
		 hemlocks of all health categories, varieties and size will be
		 photographed and annotated, providing a reference for workers in the
			field.
		 <li> To ensure full and systematic mapping we will lay out a grid
			on each site, visible by eye and on google maps, and use
			temporary marks to identify trees as they are measured.
       <li> Some observations will be repeated as a quality check.
		</ul>	
   <li> A summary health score will be calculated for each tree as the
     average of the tree's 0-3 DMR scores, unscored sections omitted.
   <li> We will estimate tree age using the formula developed by
   <a href="https://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/lter/pubs/pdf/pub214.pdf"
   target="_blank"> Harmon & Franklin, 1983</a> correcting for local conditions by coring a
   small number of dead hemlocks at Seward.
	<li> The results of the study will be available on the web in 
	tabular form and as an interactive map.  
</ol>
Our emphasis throughout will be on the careful and reproducible execution
of the protocol, deferring any search for disease causes until the
contrasting health of the two sites is firmly established.
