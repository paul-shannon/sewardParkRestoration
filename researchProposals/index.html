  <div>

	 This forest is 500 years old, largely intact here for five centuries.  In a deeper sense, the
	 forest is 8000 - 10,000 years old, continuous at this site since the end of the Ice Age,
	 dynamically regenerating after stand-replacement fires which occur about every thousand years,
	 thousands of species of plants, animals and fungi evolving together, some in competition, some
	 in mutualistic collaboration.

	 <p>
		Our goal is to foster the health of this forest for at least the next 500 years.
	 <p>

	The accelerating effects of the Anthropocene pose many threats.  Novel pathogens introduced,
	aggressive invasive plants taking over, human overuse, pollution, abnormal precipitation patterns, and rising
	temperatures.  These all threaten the health of this previously resilient forest.

	 <p> We humans are the indirect, and sometimes direct cause of these threats.
    <p> We can also be its protector.  We can discourage overuse and restore bare ground.
		We can research and maybe sometimes mitigate and remedy disease effects.
		We can track its adaptations to climate change, understand the processes at work,
		manage with a light hand.

<div class="panel">

  
Seward Park's 120 acre old-growth forest is a rare remant of a million
acres of the  forest which for 10,000 years filled the lowlands
surrounding the Salish Sea.  These forests had been resilient against
fire and insects, robust against floods and volcanoes, had been in
part sustainably managed by indigenous people.  The forests returned
to good health and rich biodiversity after every disturbance.
<p>

That changed 170 years ago.  With a hundred years, all but a thousand of those million acres
were logged, cut down, and even mostly removed from memory.
<p>

But not at Seward. Here we see a classic lowland
Douglas-Fir/Cedar/hemlock PNW forest, large enough to be a functioning
ecosystem.  It grew up after a stand-replacement fire 500 years ago,
then partly survived a less severe fire 200 years later. About a 100
mature doug firs, with thick bark, a few cedars, and (we conjecture)
many sword ferns were among the survivors.  The forest is an old and
beautiful place.  Many firs are 6 feet in diameter and more. The
forest floor includes, and is sometimes dominated by, ancient
individual sword ferns, each possibly a thousand years old, as has
been suggested to us by fern botanist David Barrington. Like the
Douglas-Fir, sword ferns colonize open ground, rarely reproduce under
a closed canopy, and live very long lives. Like in the fir, endophytic
protective fungi plausibly provide defense for the fern against
rapidly evolving pathogens and herbivores. Such mutualisms are
apparently needed by all long-lived plant species. These mutualisms,
easily seen (as in nurse logs and flower pollination) or hidden from
view (as with the endophytes) are part of the beauty of this forest.
<p>

However, at present and for the last decade, all is not well in the
forest.  Two crucial species (sword fern and western hemlock) have
severe and regionally unprecedented mortality.  These may be transient
effects: we have seen some signs of reduced mortality in the ferns.
The hemlocks do not yet provide any reason for optimism.
<p>

As citizen scientists, we study the forest, monitor populations, run
simple experiments, restore bare ground created by die-off and
enthusiastic overuse by visitors and their dogs.  We call this
'science by bake sale' or perhaps more accurately, self-funded shoestring
operations abetted, now and again, by small amounts of donated funds, and
excellent support from Seattle Parks
<p>

Our study of the fern die-off has produced substantial evidence for a
water-borne pathogen, and against drought causes.  We have some
interesting hemlock data.  Seattle Parks has done excellent work
removing invasives, and supplying mulch and native plants for our
restoration projects.  We have a scientific advisory board (SAB),
described below .
<p>

These studies and work projects will continue.  However, some of the
research question require more money and skill than we volunteers can
provide.  We need your help,  researchers and funders alike.

<p>

To that end, we have prepared a summary of our past projects, and
suggestions - with cost estimates - for possible new projects, on new
topics, but also and primarily, on the problems we have already
identified.

			 <p><li> Western Hemlock Decline<br>
				  In the first of two summers of collaboration with interns from
				  <a href="https://choose180.org" target="_blank">Choose 180</a> the Friends of
				  Seward Park quantified the dramatic decline of all ages of Western Hemlock.<br>

				 <p><li> Evidence of Robust Douglas-Fir Health<br>
					  In the summer of 2022, two UW interns joined the CHOOSE 180 interns to assess a century of Douglas-fir mortality, with these results<br>
					 <img width="1000" src="dougFirMortalityAnalysisAndPlots.jpg">
					 <p><li> Upcoming August 2023 peliminary study of mychorrhizal variety and abundance in contrasting plots, in collaboration with the Institute for Systems Biology.
						  Plots will include:  persistent bare ground, last year's deeply mulched and planted site, 3 sites with new mulch, some healthy forest sites.
						  <p><li> Soil moisture study.  A low-cost remote soil sensor uses cellphone towers to report moisture levels.  We have two sensors in close proximity, but
								apparently with different soil contacts, and with a mysterious spike in sensor 2.
								The overall slow steady decline in soil moisture is evident.  We may learn to associate relative soil moisture and plant health
								in this recently restored, and previously deeply mulched restoration site.

<button class="accordion">Proposed Work</button>
<div class="panel">
  <ol>
	 <li> Repeat the sword fern transmission experiment (beer bottle and its controlled sequel) testing for effect of fungiced and antibiotics.
		Identifying the biolocial domain of the putative pathogen will simplify subsequent identification studies.
		
	 <li> Though the virulence of the presumed pathogen appears to have decreased since its original appearance in 2014, ongoing dramatic spread in two dense sword fern sites allows for multi-factor analysis: soil, insects, microbes, characteristics of resistant ferns.
	 <li> Hemlock mortality:  <i>Rhizoctonia butini</i> is reported by OSU's LeBouldus Lab to cause needle loss like what we see.  Can we confirm the presence of R. butini?
		Is it found in the few apparently still healthy hemlocks, prior to defoliation?  A few trees of different ages are as yet unaffected.  Why?  Would watering selected trees
		during drought reduce its compounding effects, contribute to tree survival?  Note that widespread decline was observed a decade before the dramatic heat of 2015.
    <li> We have ongoing dead/bare ground restoration projects, in which planting is preceeded by deep mulching and at least one summer of mulch decay.  Known good survivors
		are selected.  Soil moisture, optimum mulching schedule and depth, species effects:  this could be done with statistical rigor.
