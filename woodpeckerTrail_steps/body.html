<h3 style="margin-top: 20px"> Woodpecker Trail Stone Steps Area </h3>

The area around the stone steps on the Woodpecker Trail has been of
concern for at least a decade.   We did extensive restoration planting
in 2015 in the area to the west - where now (again) you can see a trail leading
over the hill and towards the south.  This trail beckons - actually
leads nowhere - but attracts a steady number of interested walkers.

<p>
This area was a favorite of the "nest builders" earlier in the decade,
as was the east hill clearing just to the south.

A panoramic survey.  Note the "no boot" sign, installed in 2015.  It
has been, at best, only partially successful in discouraging off-trail
travel.

bare ground - unless transient and quickly recovering - is dead
ground.  Off-trail travel creates and perpetuates dead ground.

<h3>Nurse Log, Interrupted</h3>
Fallen trees, left to decay over hundreds of years, play a vital role
in the old growth ecosystem, rich in species diversity, essential to
the life cycle of plants and animals.   Pictured here is a doug fir
broken up by human use - abuse - unable to play that role.

    <h3>Unwelcome Art</h3>
    
Catherine Alexander photographed arrangements of sticks, debris
and branches.  One might interpret these, on first view, as benign.
<p>
But these efforts require off-trail travel to collect naturally occuring,
naturally distributed coarse woody debris.  They exemplify and
encourage a view of the forest as a human creative playground, rather
than as a fragile old-growth forest we wish to see grow on its own
terms, and according to its own processes.
