  <h2> A Roadmap for Sword Fern Research at Seward Park and in the Puget Lowlands</h2>
  <h4> Dylan Mendenhall of Haven Ecology and Paul Shannon, Friends of
    Seward Park</h4>
  <h4> May 6th 2024</h4>
  
<div id="accordion" style="height: 100px;">
  <h3> Introduction (Paul)</h3>
  <div id="introDiv" class="myContent">
<p>
We have watched for ten years as sword ferns died in Seward Park's 120
acre old-growth forest.  We call this the "sword fern blight".  We
have mapped and measured, done systematic observations, run some
experiments, and curated reports from elsewhere in the Puget Lowlands.
Preliminary study suggests that the blight is not the direct result of
changing weather patterns.  It may involve a waterborne pathogen.

<p>
Sustained formal study is now needed.  We propose here a sequence of
experiments to identify the cause (or causes) of the sword fern blight - to figure out
how and why these famously robust and long-lived plants are dying at Seward
Park and across the Puget Lowlands of Washington state.

<ul>
  <li>  A full history of our work on this problem is available at a
  <a href="https://sewardparkswordferndieoff.blogspot.com/"
     target="_blank"> blog</a> begun in 2015.
  <li> An 18-minute documentary on the ferns can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRlrcbBItVQ"
                                                            target="_blank">
      here</a>.
  <li> Good news: the die-off at Seward Park has slowed considerably,
  now moving at about 20 feet per year through a dense sword fern
    site.  In 2016 we saw spread rates of 100 feet per year.
    <li> Not so good news: this apparent drop-off in virulence predicts that
      the disease causes will be harder to identify.
      <li> There are at present two active die-off sites which invite
      close study.   See section "Active Die-Off Sites" below.
</ul>
 The blight
may have complex causes.  The microbiome and rhizobiome
of the sword fern are not well understood.  The
blight may be result of a shifting, dynamic pertubation of the
microbiome, hard to pin down.  The case studies presented below provide insight into the
complexities that this research project may encounter.

  </div>

  <h3> Current State of Knowledge (Dylan)</h3>
  <div id="currentKnowledgeDiv" class="myContent">
    <p>

Over the past decade, an enormous amount of knowledge has accrued
regarding the sword fern blight. We are now confident that a pathogen
is responsible for the phenomenon. We have also developed better
documentation of the extent of the blight in Western Washington, the
array of symptoms associated with the blight, and patterns that occur
in areas where there is observable mortality. Below is a summary of
some of the most pertinent findings.

  <h4>Mortality Patterns</h4>
  
<ul>

  <p><li>The symptoms and mortality associated with the blight can spread through sword fern populations over multiple years (personal observation), which suggests that the causal agent is both transmissible and that it is not driven by discrete climate anomalies in any given year.

  <p><li>The spread of the blight within a population can be impeded or slowed by pedestrian trails (personal observation), potentially through the interruption of the spatial continuity of the host plants, and/or through compaction of the soil.
  <p><li>Large mortality events do not appear to be associated with especially dry years.
  <p><li>Mortality is density-dependent – a greater percentage of the sword fern population dies when sword fern cover-abundance is higher (personal observation, analysis of SUNP/EC data). Additionally, there appears to be a cover-abundance threshold around 10% to 12%, below which mortality is low or absent. These findings suggest that the pathogen has limited dispersal ability and that the host plants must be in close proximity for transmission to occur.
  <p><li>In areas where large mortality events have occurred, the likelihood of survival is correlated with proximity to large trees and coarse woody debris (Shannon, 2019).
  <p><li>Co-occurring plant species appear to be unaffected by the blight (personal observation), which suggests that the pathogen is host-specific to sword fern.
  <ul>
    <p><li>Dryopteris species appear to be unaffected by the blight(personal observation). This genus shares the same family as sword ferns (Dryopteridaceae). Dryopteris expansa and Dryopteris filix-mas have both been observed in Seward Park.
  </ul>
  <p><li>Following a large mortality event, the pathogen appears to be unable to induce symptoms in new ferns introduced to the site (Shannon, 2022), which suggests that it may be absent from areas where it was previously transmissible, and suggests that the pathogen is dependent on a living host to persist in the environment.
</ul>

<h4>Morpho-Physiological Symptoms</h4>

<ul>
   <p><li>Foliar symptoms resemble drought stress and range in severity (personal observation):
     <ul>
       <li>Crispate pinnae
       <li>Twisted rachises
       <li>Tip die-back
       <li>Discoloration
    </ul>
  <p><li>Frond production in symptomatic ferns can slowly decrease over multiple years, resulting in asymmetrical quantities of fronds across all cohorts on any given plant (Mendenhall and Barrera, 2021). Additionally, fiddleheads/leaf buds appear to be underdeveloped in symptomatic ferns, or they whither after initially forming.
  <p><li>Symptoms can be experimentally induced (Mendenhall et al., 2019; Shannon, 2022, 2020).
      <ul>
        <li>Results from the greenhouse transmission experiment suggest that the causal agent is likely present in the foliage and can be transmitted through water as a medium.
        <li>Results from the field experiments suggest that the causal agent is unevenly distributed in Seward Park, with greater pathogen pressure in areas where the symptoms and mortality are actively developing in the endemic sword fern population. Additionally, irrigation during the summer does not appear to prevent the development of symptoms. These findings suggest that if seasonal drought stress interacts with the pathogen, it likely acts as a compounding stressor, but by itself does not drive the phenomenon.
      </ul>

      <p><li>During the summer, symptomatic ferns have lower foliar moisture content than apparently healthy ferns even when soil moisture content is similar (Mendenhall and Barrera, 2021).
   </ul>

<h4>Microbiome</h4>

There are significant differences in the composition of the fungal
endophyte communities in the rhizomes of symptomatic ferns compared
with healthy ferns, but no fungal taxa were significantly associated
with the symptomatic ferns.

<p>

  Paul Shannon offers a cautionary note on our 2021 results.
  Our then collaborators, Ylva Lekberg and Mary Ellyn DuPre reported:

<ul>
   <li> Mary Ellyn: "Cronartiaceae (C. ribicola) sequences in my analysis were not
   significantly different among rhizome samples, but only because I
   removed one (highly amplified) outlier in the healthy samples which
   altered the distribution of the data, plus, all other samples were
   within the same sequence range. Did you remove this out of your
   analysis too?  Overall, the biggest take-home of this analysis is
   the observation that there were (marginal and significant) shifts
   in fungal communities within healthy/symptomatic rhizomes and
   between rhizomes and leaves." (email 5/17/2021)

  <li> Ylva: "most of [the rhizome] tissue is dead so either roots or
     leaves moving forward would make more sense" (email 5/25/2021).

  <li> Dylan: "My analysis of the leaves was pretty limited because it's only
     3 samples, all from symptomatic ferns." (Dylan Mendenhall, email 4/5/2021)

</ul>

    </p>
  </div>
  <h3> Knowledge Gaps (Dylan)</h3>
  <div id="knowledgeGapsDiv" class="myContent">
Many gaps remain in our understanding of the sword fern
blight. Additionally, some of the recent findings have raised new
questions about the ecology of the pathogen.

<ul>
   <p><li> What is the taxonomic identity of the pathogen?
   <p><li> Are other Polystichum species vulnerable to the blight or potential hosts to the pathogen?
   <p><li> How does the pathogen spread?
   <p><li> Is there a cover-abundance or density threshold in sword fern populations that inhibits the spread of the pathogen?
   <p><li> What is the mechanism that allows CWD and large trees to facilitate survival in areas where there is high mortality?
   <p><li> How does the pathogen interfere with water transport in the leaves?
   <p><li> Are the ferns that survive large mortality events resistant to the pathogen?
</ul>

  <h3> The Disease Triangle and its Extensions:  Tetrahedron, 
  Pathobiome (Paul)</h3>
<div>
Plant pathologists traditionally model the health of a plant as the interaction of
  the plant, the environment, and a pathogen.   Recent research
  teaches us that every plant is accompanied by a community of
  microbes: fungi, bacteria, oomyctes, viruses.  Some of these are
  beneficial, some are harmful, many are neutral with respect to
  health.  The dynamics of the microbial community play a crucial role
  in plant health and disese.   Consequently, the traditional notion
  of a disease triangle has been expanded: disease tetrahedron and
  pathobiome network.
<p>
The following discussion draws upon a 2017 article in Annnual Review of Phytopathology,
in which the traditional disease triangle, and its extensions are described.

  <a href=https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-phyto-080516-035641
     target="_blank">Ecology and Genomic Insights into Plant-Pathogenic and
  Plant-Nonpathogenic Endophytes</a>
<p>
<img src="diseaseTriangle.png">
<p>
With the inclusion of interacting biotic factors, reflecting our increasing understanding of
the multiplicity of factors which combine in health and disease, the
triangle becomes a tetrahedron:
</p>
<img src="diseaseTetrahedron.png">

<p>
The paper provides this background:
<blockquote>

  Plants are colonized by complex microbial communities that play
  different roles regarding plant growth and health. Whereas some
  microbial members are detrimental and cause diseases, others promote
  plant growth and enhance nutrient acquisition and tolerance to
  biotic and abiotic stresses via a multitude of mechanisms.
  <p>

   A large fraction of the microbial community can be defined as
   commensal microorganisms that find their niche in the association
   with plants but have no known function to their hosts. Depending on
   different plant environments, microbiota associated with plants can
   be found on the exterior of plants, such as the rhizozphere or the
   phyllosphere, or in the interior of plants, such as the
   endosphere. Plants may be colonized by pathogens and nonpathogenic
   endophytes, which spend at least part of their life cycle inside
   plants.

  <p>
   [T]here are both pathogenic and nonpathogenic endophytes. First, most isolated
   endophytes are tested on a single or a few plant species, and even
   if they show no deleterious effects on these plants, they may
   exhibit pathogenicity on other plant hosts. Furthermore,
   pathogenicity depends on a number of environmental parameters and
   biotic interactions. For instance, fluorescent pseudomonads,
   frequently showing plant-beneficial effects, can cause disease on
   leatherleaf ferns under specific conditions [<i>we describe this
   phenomenon in the next section</i>]. In addition, with
   the advent of molecular tools to investigate microbiomes without
   the need of cultivation leading to a number of uncharacterized taxa
   in an environment, functions such as pathogenicity or mutualism can
   rarely be predicted. The advent of molecular tools enables the
   investigation of microbiomes without the need of cultivation, which
   leads to the identification of a number of uncharacterized
   endophytic microorganisms. Their functions, such as pathogenicity
   or mutualism, can rarely be predicted.
    
</blockquote>

The authors conclude that "disease is driven by a highly complex disease
network in which different abiotic and biotic factors interact and
influence each other. For instance, exposure of the
plant-microbe system to a specific temperature or soil environment
results in a specific plant condition, which, together with
temperature/soil environment, shapes the associated microbiota and its
interactions. Therefore, disease occurs only at specific points of
this network or at specific combinations of all factors."
<p>
And offer this figure:
<p>
<img src="pathobiome.png">
<p>
Network of microbiome interactions that either (i) suppress or (ii)
favor pathogen establishment and performance. Environmental factors,
such as (clockwise from top left) radiation, precipitation,
temperature, and soil parameters may affect the microbiome directly or
indirectly via the plant host.

<p> As we follow the research roadmap proposed here, we may be
  fortunate, and quickly identify a single novel (or lost) fungal
  endophyte responsible for the sword fern blight.
<p>
  But we may not be so lucky.  The blight may be due to a complex
  and shifting combination of factors, abiotic and biotic, 
  perhaps including interacting insect vectors,
  bacterial pathogenicity islands, quorum sensing,  oomyctes and fungi.

<h3> Disease Case Study 1: Leatherleaf Fern Distortion Syndrome (Paul)</h3>
<div class="myContent">
It is no surprise that the best recent example of fern disease
research involves an economically valuable species: the primarily
Southern Hemisphere tropical LeatherLeaf Fern, <i>Rumora adiantiformis</i>.
Popular for floral arrangements, it was imported from Florida to Costa
Rica in the 1980's, where it became an important agricultural
export crop.  By the late 90's, the Fern Distortion Syndrome (FDS) had
arrived, and was widespread.
<p>
  The following remarks are drawn from two papers:
  <ol>
    <li>
    2010: <a href="https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS-94-8-0940"
    target="_blank">Fern Distortion Syndrome of Leatherleaf Fern in Costa Rica: Symptoms, Incidence, and Severity</a>
    <li> 2013:

         target="_blank"> Symptoms of Fern Distortion Syndrome Resulting
         from Inoculation with Opportunistic Endophytic Fluorescent
        Pseudomonas spp</a>
  </ol>

  <h4> A summary of the 2010 paper</h4>
  <ul>
    <p><li> Early studies examined soil physical and
    chemical properties, plant nutrition, insect and nematode
    populations, searched for fungal, bacterial, viral and oomycetes
    infection.  No cause was found, no articles published; only tetrycycline spraying may
    have been mildly effective in reducing symptoms.
        
    <p><li> Growers reported that the syndrome appears to be
    transmitted via rhizomatic propagation, when rhizomes and soils
    are moved to a new growing site.
    <p><li> None of the studies carried out between 1998 and 2004
    identified any single specific pathogen.
    <p><li> For reasons unmention in the 2010 paper, it was decided to
    test rhizomatic population of endophytic fluorescent pseudomonas,
    an endemic Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium.
    <p><li> 2005 sampling protocol tested the hypothesis that
    distorted fronds are associated with reduced growth (small size)
    in rhizomes and roots.  Rhizomes were collected from symptomatic
    and asymptomatic ferns, characterized for vascular discoloration,
    cultured for pseudomonas.
    <p><li> Both scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM,
    TEM) was
    applied to samples from pinnae, rachises, rhizomes and roots,
    apparently to detect "inclusion bodies". 
    <p><li> Rhizomes were tested for dsRNA viral loads.
    <p><li> Rhizomes were tested for increased population of
    pseudomonas in symptomatic vs asymptomatic ferns.
    <p><li> FDS is associated with reduced rhizome diameter and weight.
    <p><li> Streaked and discolored rhizome vascular tissue in symptomatic
        plants, when cultured, produced pseudomonas colonies.
    <p><li> EM revealed no vascular abnormality, no microbes.  Some
    necrosis seen in root vascular bundles, but no microbes.
    <p><li> TEM study of the nuclei of most spongy mesophyll cells
    from young pinnae exhibed large, very granulated nucleoli
    <p><li> Mitochondria of parenchyma and phloem cells shows breakage
    and swelling of the cristae.  Some chloroplasts of these cells had
    aberrant architecture.
    <p><li> Symptomatic plants were enriched for bacteria in
    intercellular spaces of the spongy mesophyll of the pinnae.  No
    fungi were detected in any of the EM work.
    <p><li> PCR viral assays gave no positive result.
    <p><li> Ensuing field work:  culturable pseudomonas found in
    symptomatic ferns at 5 of 6 commercial ferneries.
  </ul>

In followup to the 2010 paper, in the style of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch%27s_postulates"
  target="_blank">Koch Postulates</a>,  Kloepper et al sought to
  reproduce FDS symptoms in healthy greenhouse ferns by innoculating with
  endophytic Fluorescent pseudomonas species.
  <h4> A summary of the 2013 paper</h4>
  <ul>
    <p><li> 29 month greenhouse experiment.
    <p><li> 8x9 randomized complete block experimental design.
    <p><li> virulence genes expressed in a mixed species population
    when those populations reach a minimum level.
    <p><li> 16S rRNA library discriminates successfully among various
    strains of pseudomonas.
    <p><li> Strains derived from the field: clear differences between
    strains found in symptomatic and asymptomatic ferns.
        <p><li> tobacco leaf hypersentivity reaction (HR) proved useful:
            <ul>
              <li>  none of the pseudomonads isolated from inside
 rhizomes of healthy-appearing, asymptomatic plants without a history
                of Benlate use elicited HR in tobacco leaves
              <li> HR was elicited by 77% of the fluorescent
                 pseudomonas isolated from inside rhizomes or from
                  the rhizosphere of diseased, symptomatic ferns
                  within 24–48 hours after inoculation.
              <li>Of these strains, 17% produced the classical HR
 consisting of a dry, brown interveinal necrosis in 24–36 hours, which
                    is an indication that a bacterial strain is pathogenic [6]
              <li> 60% produced a wet, black interveinal
                      necrosis in 48 hours.
                      This black, wet necrosis resembled symptoms of
                      bacterial soft rot caused by pectinolytic
                      enzymes and led us to investigate the frequency
                      of pectinolytic enzyme production via the potato
                      slice maceration test.
                      </ul>
         
  </ul>
  In conclusion, the authors write:

  <ul>
    <p><li> genes for production of virulence factors may move among species of
phylogenetic groups of bacteria in the rhizosphere or inside plants,
and expression of the virulence factors can relate to the population
        density of the bacterial strains.
    <p><li> For example, several virulence
factors have been shown to be regulated by bacterial cell density via
quorum sensing, including elicitation of HR [16], production of IAA
[17], and production of cell wall degrading enzymes including
        pectinase [19], [20].

        <p><li>In addition, quorum sensing regulates both
horizontal gene transfer and bacterial colonization of plant hosts
            [19].
<p><li>     Based upon these reports and our results, we propose the
    following model for how fluorescent pseudomonads cause FDS.

    <p><li>Among the
native population of bacteria in the rhizosphere and inside rhizomes
of healthy ferns are groups of fluorescent pseudomonads, and likely
other eubacterial genera, that contain genes for production of
        virulence and colonization factors.
        <p><li>Perturbations in the growth of
ferns, such as the application of specific systemic fungicides [3],
            trigger population increases of these bacterial groups.
            <p><li>As populations
increase, quorum sensing activates expression of colonization and
virulence factors as well as horizontal transfer of virulence genes to
                other closely related phylogenetic groups.
                <p><li>Over time, there is a shift
in bacterial community inside rhizomes with a concomitant development
of symptoms of FDS. This model is consistent with previous studies
reviewed in Berg et al. [19] that the rhizosphere is a reservoir of
opportunistic pathogens that cause human infections.

zero c 2016.  He examined affected fronds and suggested that the

<h3> Disease Case Study 3:  Multitrophic Interactions (Paul)</h3>

<div class="myContent">

For another example of complex relations possibly involved in the sword
fern blight, we turn here to a 2023 PNAS journal article:
<p>
    
  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2216922120"
     target="_blank">A soil fungus confers plant resistance against a
     phytophagous insect by disrupting the symbiotic role of its gut
    microbiota</a>
<p>  
This study reinforces the notion that a novel pathogenic endophyte may
not explain the sword fern blight, but the loss of a protective community member
involved in the microhabitat and trophic relations of the host plant.
<p>

  <h4>Abstract</h4>

  Plants generate energy flows through natural food webs, driven by
  competition for resources among organisms, which are part of a
  complex network of multitrophic interactions. Here, we demonstrate
  that the interaction between tomato plants and a phytophagous insect
  is driven by a hidden interplay between their respective
  microbiotas. Tomato plants colonized by the soil fungus
  Trichoderma afroharzianum, a beneficial microorganism widely used in
  agriculture as a biocontrol agent, negatively affects the
  development and survival of the lepidopteran pest Spodoptera
  littoralis by altering the larval gut microbiota and its nutritional
  support to the host. Indeed, experiments aimed to restore the
  functional microbial community in the gut allow a complete
  rescue. Our results shed light on a novel role played by a soil
  microorganism in the modulation of plant–insect interaction...


  <h4>Significance</h4>

 Plant multitrophic interactions are extremely complex, and the
 underlying mechanisms are not easy to unravel. Using tomato plants as
 a model system, we demonstrated that a soil fungus, Trichoderma
 afroharzianum, widely used as a biocontrol agent of plant pathogens,
 negatively affects the development and survival of the lepidopteran
 pest Spodoptera littoralis by altering the gut microbiota and its
 symbiotic contribution to larval nutrition. Our results indicate that
 insect-plant interactions can be correctly interpreted only at the
 metaorganism level, focusing on the broad network of interacting
 holobionts which spans across the soil and the above-ground
 biosphere. Here, we provide a new functional framework for studying
 these intricate trophic networks and their ecological relevance.

<h3> Brett Younginger's Fern Endophyte Sequencing (Paul)</h3>

<div class="myContent">
As a PhD student Brett Younginger developed laboratory methods for
sequencing the DNA of sword ferns, Polystichum munitum.  The
Younginger
protocol, of a variation on it, will likely be used in this project's
sequencing.
<p>
The first of
his two papers on this topic is
<p>
  <a href="https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3732/ajb.1700149" target="_blank">
    Fungal endophyte communities in the temperate fern Polystichum
    munitum show early colonization and extensive temporal turnover (2017)
  </a>

  <h5>PREMISE OF THE STUDY</h5>
  
   Fungal endophytes have been shown to colonize all land plants, yet
   surprisingly little attention has been given to their community
   composition in ferns. We examined the diversity and temporal
   turnover of fungal endophytes in foliar tissue of the temperate
   western sword fern, Polystichum munitum, comparing taxa in newly
   emerged leaflets and in the same fronds after 1 mo of exposure in
   the field.

   <h5>METHODS</h5>

   Utilizing next-generation sequencing, we sampled pinnae from
   P. munitum in spring, 2–3 d after they emerged. We additionally
   sampled pinnae 30 d later from the same fern blades. From these
   samples, we sequenced fungal DNA to characterize the initial
   colonization and temporal turnover of endophytes in the host.

   <h5>KEY RESULTS</h5>

   We demonstrate that P. munitum is abundantly colonized by
   endophytes in newly emerged foliar tissue. However, 1 mo later, the
   community composition undergoes a marked shift: the overall
   richness of endophytes increases, but the evenness of the community
   wanes as a single taxon, Flagellospora fusarioides, comes to
   dominate.

   <h5>CONCLUSIONS</h5>

    We conclude that P. munitum hosts a variety of fungal endophyte
    taxa, similarly to other land plants. However, the rapid shift of
    the endophyte community we report is an unprecedented
    observation. Therefore, we further conclude that repeated sampling
    should be the standard in endophyte studies, because single
    sampling events are not sufficient to capture the dynamic nature
    of these cryptic microfungi.

    Stable coexistence or competitive exclusion? Fern endophytes
    demonstrate rapid turnover favouring a dominant fungus
    </a>

  <h4>Abstract</h4>

    Fungal endophytes are critical members of the plant microbiome,
    but their commu- nity dynamics throughout an entire growing season
    are underexplored. Additionally, most fungal endophyte research
    has centred on seed-reproducing hosts, while spore- reproducing
    plants also host endophytes and may be colonized by unique commu-
    nity members. In order to examine annual fungal endophyte
    community dynamics in a spore-reproducing host, we explored
    endophytes in a single population of ferns, Polystichum munitum,
  in the Pacific Northwest.
<p>
    Through metabarcoding, we charac-
    terized the community assembly and temporal turnover of foliar
    endophytes through- out a growing season. From these results, we
    selected endophytes with outsized representations in sequence data
    and performed in vitro competition assays. Finally, we inoculated
    sterile fern gametophytes with dominant fungi observed in the
  field and determined their effects on host performance.
<p>
     Sequencing
    demonstrated that ferns were colonized by a diverse community of
    fungal endophytes in newly emerged tissue, but diversity decreased
    throughout the season leading to the preponder- ance of a single
    fungus in later sampling months. This previously undescribed endo-
    phyte appears to abundantly colonize the host to the detriment of
  other microfungi.
<p>
    Competition assays on a variety of media types
    failed to demonstrate that the domi- nant fungus was competitive
    against other fungi isolated from the same hosts, and inoculation
    onto sterile fern gametophytes did not alter growth compared to
    sterile controls, suggesting its effects are not antagonistic. The
    presence of this endophyte in the fern population probably
    demonstrates a case of repeated colonization driving competitive
    exclusion of other fungal community members.

<h3> Potential Experiments (Dylan)</h3>

<div class="myContent">
  <h4>Experiment 1: Exploratory Microscopy</h4>

  This study would use basic microscopy techniques to determine the
  physiological size and structures of the pathogen, potentially
  narrowing down the taxonomy to kingdom or phylum. Microscopy could
  also help us better understand how the vascular system of fronds are
  potentially impacted by the pathogen or the host-plant’s own immune
  response.

  <h5> Questions</h5>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the taxonomic identity of the pathogen?
      <li>How does the pathogen interfere with water transport in the
        leaves?
        </ul>
<h5> Objective</h5>
Identify diagnostic features of microorganisms in the fronds of healthy and symptomatic ferns.
Compare the vascular tissue of healthy and symptomatic fronds, including latitudinal-sections and cross-sections from the rachises and pinnae.
<h5>Methods</h5>
<ul>
<li>Use microtome or carrot technique to prepare sections of plant structures on wet mount
<li>Use staining techniques as needed to document features of fungi and bacteria
</ul>
<h5>Considerations: Advantages</h5>
<ul>
<li>Microscopy could narrow down the range of potential taxa that will be targeted in the metagenomic study (e.g. fungi, bacteria, oomycetes).
<li>Microscopy is uniquely capable of determining any potential changes to the physiology of the vascular tissue in sword fern fronds.
</ul>
<h5>Considerations: Disdvantages</h5>
<ul>
  <li>   Microscopy has a limited capacity for identifying microbial taxa, especially if diagnostic features have yet to be established for an organism of interest.
</ul>
</ul>
  
  <h4>Experiment 2: Metagenomic Sequencing</h4>
  
<h5>Question</h5>
What is the taxonomic identity of the pathogen?
<h5>Objective</h5>
Compare the composition of microbial communities (bacteria, fungi, oomycetes) in the fronds symptomatic and health ferns.
<h5>Methods</h5>
<ul>
 <li>Use criteria from previous field studies to identify symptomatic and health sword ferns (Mendenhall and Barrera, 2021).
 <li>Extract DNA from sword ferns fronds during the mid to late summer when we would expect the foliar microbiomes to converge – previous research suggests that a single fungal endophyte typically dominates (Younginger and Ballhorn, 2017).
 <li>Use paired-end amplicon sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of the ITS and 16S rDNA regions.
 <li>Analyze exact sequence variants (ESVs) using indicator species
   analysis.
   </ul>
<h5>Considerations: Advantages</h5>
<ul>
  <li> Metagenomic sequencing is a powerful approach to finding the metaphorical needle in a haystack. This molecular approach can identify even trace amounts of DNA in a sample, akin to “purchasing the whole haystack”.
  <li>It would be relatively easy for a collaborator to assist with a pilot study by including a small number of our samples in their own sequencing run.
  <li>Samples from other studies could be included in a larger
  sequencing run for exploratory analysis. For example, DNA extracts
  from foliar samples and invertebrate specimens from the hemlock
    study and included in the sequencing run
    </ul>


<h5>Considerations: Disadvantages</h5>
<ul>
<li>Amplicon sequencing is so sensitive that it is vulnerable to potential contamination in the field and lab - it is common for spore DNA to cause spurious results. For example, in Brett Younginger’s 2017 study, they ostensibly found chanterelles in the endophyte community. The use of blanks and negative controls is standard practice to mitigate this risk.
<li>Most sequencing facilities require the purchase of a full sequencing run, which imposes relatively high fixed costs on this experiment. It may be prohibitively expensive to conduct a pilot study with a small sample size or pooled samples.
<li>Plant diseases are not commonly caused by viruses, but nonetheless, this molecular approach would not be capable of identifying potential viral pathogens.
<li>Amplicon sequencing is a PCR-based method that introduces its own
  biases to the data as a result of primer bias, amplicon length, PCR
  cycling parameters and stochastic molecular
  interactions. Heteroduplexes, artifacts and skewed relatively
  abundances are not uncommon in the sequencing results.
</ul>


<h3> Experiment 3: Mesh Barrier Study</h3>

This study would replicate the methods of previous transmission studies by planting ferns in areas where the sword fern blight appears to be actively developing. Mesh barriers would be used to restrict the movement of soil organisms of varying size.
<h5>Questions</h5>
<ul>
<li>What is the taxonomic identity of the pathogen?
<li>How does the pathogen spread?
</ul>

<h5>Objectives</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Determine whether the pathogen spreads aboveground or belowground
  <li>Determine whether the pathogen is a free-living organism in the
    soil or if it requires an invertebrate vector
    </ul>


<h5>Methods</h5>
<ul>
<li>Experimental design: two-factor comparison of planting location (symptomatic population vs healthy population) and mesh size (e.g. 5 μm, 30 μm, no mesh)
<li>Install nursery-grown ferns in close proximity to mature local sword ferns.
<li>Alternatively, the negative control could be planted in areas of Seward Park where the pathogen is thought to have been extinguished (i.e. the Ground Zero site).
<li>Irrigate plants during their first drought season.
<li>Monitor symptom severity and mortality rates for 2 to 3 years.
</ul>

<h5>Considerations: Advantages</h5>
<ul>
 <li>The experimental design of this transmission study is extremely flexible, allowing it to be modified to address many other potential factors related to the transmission or inhibition of the blight, such as the proximity of coarse woody debris, drought stress as a compounding factor, the role of fungal networks in redistributing water in the soil profile, or different Polystichum species as potential hosts.
 <li>This experiment would likely confirm if the pathogen spreads aboveground or belowground, which would greatly inform management practices that have the potential to transport or disturb soil, such as plant installation and manual removal of invasive plants.
 <li> The mesh barrier treatment can be used to selectively restrict the growth of soil fungi and other soil microorganisms, providing insight into the potential role of saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungal networks.
</ul>

<h5>Considerations: Disadvantages</h5>
<ul>
<li>It could take 1 to 2 years to propagate different Polystichum species under consistent nursery conditions. This aspect of the study may require field expeditions to collect spores from different target species.
<li>This study is time sensitive because it relies on the blight actively spreading through a sword fern population. There may be a limited window of time when this experiment could be successfully done in Seward Park before the endemic sword fern population is effectively exhausted.
<li>This study would not be able to identify specific taxa as candidate pathogens. It would only yield information on the maximum diameter of the pathogen or its vector.
<li>Field experiments tend to be very labor intensive
<li>In previous transmission experiments, symptoms took years to develop.
<li>This experiment would only detect visible signs of the blight,
  such as differences in mortality, frond production or
  morpho-physiological symptoms. Ferns potentially could be hosts to
  the pathogen even if they have no visible symptoms associated with
  the blight. However, tissue samples from all ferns including the
  study could be used for subsequent molecular work.
  </ul>

<h3> Experiment 4: Host Vulnerability Study</h3>

This study would replicate the methods of previous transmission
studies by planting multiple species of ferns in areas where the sword
fern blight appears to be actively developing. Optionally, a follow up
study could use the ferns from this experiment as inoculum to see if
the pathogen can be transmitted from non-sword fern species back to
sword ferns. Additionally, foliar tissue from this experiment could be
included in the metagenomic sequencing study.

<h5>Questions</h5>
Are other Polystichum species vulnerable to the blight or potential hosts to the pathogen?
<h5>Objectives</h5>
Determine if other Polystichum species are vulnerable to the blight
<h5>Methods</h5>
<ul>
  <li> Experimental design: two-factor comparison of planting location (symptomatic population vs healthy population) and species (Polystichum munitum, other related species)
  <li> Other species could include:
    <ul>
<li>Dryopteris expansa (native)
<li>Dryopteris filix-mas (native)
<li>Polystichum andersonii (native)
<li>Polystichum californicum (native)
<li>Polystichum imbricans (native)
<li>Polystichum tsussimense (non-native)
</ul>
<li>Install nursery-grown ferns in close proximity to mature local sword ferns.
<li>Alternatively, the negative control could be planted in areas of Seward Park where the pathogen is thought to have been extinguished (i.e. the Ground Zero site)
<li>Irrigate plants during their first drought season.
<li>Monitor symptom severity and mortality rates for 2 to 3 years.
</ul>
<h5>Considerations: Advantages</h5>

<ul>
  <li>The experimental design of this transmission study is extremely flexible, allowing it to be modified to address many other potential factors related to the transmission or inhibition of the blight, such as the proximity of coarse woody debris, drought stress as a compounding factor, or the role of fungal networks in redistributing water in the soil profile.
  <li>Understanding the vulnerability of other closely related fern
  species could provide insight to other potential stakeholders about
    the need for further research into the phenomenon.
</ul>

<h5>Considerations: Disadvantages</h5>
<ul>
  <li> It could take 1 to 2 years to propagate different fern species under consistent nursery conditions. This aspect of the study may require field expeditions to collect spores from different target species. Alternatively, native ferns from Washington, Oregon and California could potentially be transplanted directly into the field experiment.
  <li> This study is time sensitive because it relies on the blight actively spreading through a sword fern population. There may be a limited window of time when this experiment could be successfully done in Seward Park before the endemic sword fern population is effectively exhausted.
  <li>Field experiments tend to be very labor intensive
  <li>In previous transmission experiments, symptoms took years to develop.
  <li>This experiment would only detect visible signs of the blight, such as differences in mortality, frond production or morpho-physiological symptoms. Other Polystichum species could be potentially hosts to the pathogen even if they have no visible symptoms associated with the blight. However, tissue samples from all ferns including the study could be used for subsequent molecular work.
  <li>Exposing non-sword fern Polystichum species to the blight
  creates the risk of creating conditions where the pathogen could
    host jump and potentially endanger a new species.
