<h2> A Roadmap for Sword Fern Research</h2>
<div id="accordion" style="height: 100px;">
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <div id="introDiv" class="myContent">
<p>
We have watched for ten years as sword ferns have die in Seward Park's 120
acre old-growth forest: the sword fern blight.  We have mapped and measured, done systematic
made observations, run some experiments, and curated reports from elsewhere in
the Puget Lowlands.  Preliminary study suggests that the
is not the direct result of changing weather patterns, and that
may involve a waterborne pathogen.

<p>
Sustained formal study is now needed.  We propose a sequence of
experiments to identify cause of the sword fern blight - to explain
how these famously robust and long-lived plants are dying at Seward
Park and across the Puget Lowlands of Washington state.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Current State of Knowledge</h3>
  <div id="currentKnowledgeDiv" class="myContent">
    <p>

Over the past decade, an enormous amount of knowledge has accrued
regarding the sword fern blight. We are now confident that a pathogen
is responsible for the phenomenon. We have also developed better
documentation of the extent of the blight in Western Washington, the
array of symptoms associated with the blight, and patterns that occur
in areas where there is observable mortality. Below is a summary of
some of the most pertinent findings.

  <h4>Mortality Patterns</h4>
  
<ul>

  <p><li>The symptoms and mortality associated with the blight can spread through sword fern populations over multiple years (personal observation), which suggests that the causal agent is both transmissible and that it is not driven by discrete climate anomalies in any given year.

  <p><li>The spread of the blight within a population can be impeded or slowed by pedestrian trails (personal observation), potentially through the interruption of the spatial continuity of the host plants, and/or through compaction of the soil.
  <p><li>Large mortality events do not appear to be associated with especially dry years.
  <p><li>Mortality is density-dependent – a greater percentage of the sword fern population dies when sword fern cover-abundance is higher (personal observation, analysis of SUNP/EC data). Additionally, there appears to be a cover-abundance threshold around 10% to 12%, below which mortality is low or absent. These findings suggest that the pathogen has limited dispersal ability and that the host plants must be in close proximity for transmission to occur.
  <p><li>In areas where large mortality events have occurred, the likelihood of survival is correlated with proximity to large trees and coarse woody debris (Shannon, 2019).
  <p><li>Co-occurring plant species appear to be unaffected by the blight (personal observation), which suggests that the pathogen is host-specific to sword fern.
  <ul>
    <p><li>Dryopteris species appear to be unaffected by the blight(personal observation). This genus shares the same family as sword ferns (Dryopteridaceae). Dryopteris expansa and Dryopteris filix-mas have both been observed in Seward Park.
  </ul>
  <p><li>Following a large mortality event, the pathogen appears to be unable to induce symptoms in new ferns introduced to the site (Shannon, 2022), which suggests that it may be absent from areas where it was previously transmissible, and suggests that the pathogen is dependent on a living host to persist in the environment.
</ul>

<h4>Morpho-Physiological Symptoms</h4>

<ul>
   <p><li>Foliar symptoms resemble drought stress and range in severity (personal observation):
     <ul>
       <li>Crispate pinnae
       <li>Twisted rachises
       <li>Tip die-back
       <li>Discoloration
    </ul>
  <p><li>Frond production in symptomatic ferns can slowly decrease over multiple years, resulting in asymmetrical quantities of fronds across all cohorts on any given plant (Mendenhall and Barrera, 2021). Additionally, fiddleheads/leaf buds appear to be underdeveloped in symptomatic ferns, or they whither after initially forming.
  <p><li>Symptoms can be experimentally induced (Mendenhall et al., 2019; Shannon, 2022, 2020).
      <ul>
        <li>Results from the greenhouse transmission experiment suggest that the causal agent is likely present in the foliage and can be transmitted through water as a medium.
        <li>Results from the field experiments suggest that the causal agent is unevenly distributed in Seward Park, with greater pathogen pressure in areas where the symptoms and mortality are actively developing in the endemic sword fern population. Additionally, irrigation during the summer does not appear to prevent the development of symptoms. These findings suggest that if seasonal drought stress interacts with the pathogen, it likely acts as a compounding stressor, but by itself does not drive the phenomenon.
      </ul>

      <p><li>During the summer, symptomatic ferns have lower foliar moisture content than apparently healthy ferns even when soil moisture content is similar (Mendenhall and Barrera, 2021).
   </ul>

<h4>Microbiome</h4>

There are significant differences in the composition of the fungal
endophyte communities in the rhizomes of symptomatic ferns compared
with healthy ferns, but no fungal taxa were significantly associated
with the symptomatic ferns (CITATION).



    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Knowledge Gaps</h3>
  <div id="knowledgeGapsDiv" class="myContent">
Many gaps remain in our understanding of the sword fern
blight. Additionally, some of the recent findings have raised new
questions about the ecology of the pathogen.

<ul>
   <p><li> What is the taxonomic identity of the pathogen?
   <p><li> Are other Polystichum species vulnerable to the blight or potential hosts to the pathogen?
   <p><li> How does the pathogen spread?
   <p><li> Is there a cover-abundance or density threshold in sword fern populations that inhibits the spread of the pathogen?
   <p><li> What is the mechanism that allows CWD and large trees to facilitate survival in areas where there is high mortality?
   <p><li> How does the pathogen interfere with water transport in the leaves?
   <p><li> Are the ferns that survive large mortality events resistant to the pathogen?
</ul>

  <h3> The Disease Triangle and its Extensions:  Tetrahedron, 
  Pathobiome</h3>
<div>
Plant pathologists traditionally model the health of a plant as the interaction of
  the plant itself, the environment, and a pathogen.   Recent research
  teaches us that every plant is accompanied by a community of
  microbes: fungi, bacteria, oomyctes, viruses.  Some of these are
  beneficial, some are harmful, many are neutral with respect to
  health.  The dynamics of the microbial community play a crucial role
  in plant health and disese.   Consequently, the traditional notion
  of a disease triangle has been expanded: disease tetrahedron and
  pathobiome network.
<p>
The following discussion draws upon a 2017 article in Annnual Review of Phytopathology,
in which the traditional disease triangle, and its extensions are described.

  <a href=https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-phyto-080516-035641
     target="_blank">Ecology and Genomic Insights into Plant-Pathogenic and
  Plant-Nonpathogenic Endophytes</a>
<p>
<img src="diseaseTriangle.png">
<p>
With the inclusion of interacting biotic factors, reflecting our increasing understanding of
the multiplicity of factors which combine in health and disease, the
triangle becomes a tetrahedron:
</p>
<img src="diseaseTetrahedron.png">

<p>
The paper provides this background:
<blockquote>

  Plants are colonized by complex microbial communities that play
  different roles regarding plant growth and health. Whereas some
  microbial members are detrimental and cause diseases, others promote
  plant growth and enhance nutrient acquisition and tolerance to
  biotic and abiotic stresses via a multitude of mechanisms.
  <p>

   A large fraction of the microbial community can be defined as
   commensal microorganisms that find their niche in the association
   with plants but have no known function to their hosts. Depending on
   different plant environments, microbiota associated with plants can
   be found on the exterior of plants, such as the rhizozphere or the
   phyllosphere, or in the interior of plants, such as the
   endosphere. Plants may be colonized by pathogens and nonpathogenic
   endophytes, which spend at least part of their life cycle inside
   plants.

  <p>
   [T]here are both pathogenic and nonpathogenic endophytes. First, most isolated
   endophytes are tested on a single or a few plant species, and even
   if they show no deleterious effects on these plants, they may
   exhibit pathogenicity on other plant hosts. Furthermore,
   pathogenicity depends on a number of environmental parameters and
   biotic interactions. For instance, fluorescent pseudomonads,
   frequently showing plant-beneficial effects, can cause disease on
   leatherleaf ferns under specific conditions [<i>we describe this
   phenomenon in the next section</i>]. In addition, with
   the advent of molecular tools to investigate microbiomes without
   the need of cultivation leading to a number of uncharacterized taxa
   in an environment, functions such as pathogenicity or mutualism can
   rarely be predicted. The advent of molecular tools enables the
   investigation of microbiomes without the need of cultivation, which
   leads to the identification of a number of uncharacterized
   endophytic microorganisms. Their functions, such as pathogenicity
   or mutualism, can rarely be predicted.
    
</blockquote>

The authors conclude that "disease is driven by a highly complex disease
network in which different abiotic and biotic factors interact and
influence each other. For instance, exposure of the
plant-microbe system to a specific temperature or soil environment
results in a specific plant condition, which, together with
temperature/soil environment, shapes the associated microbiota and its
interactions. Therefore, disease occurs only at specific points of
this network or at specific combinations of all factors."
<p>
And offer this figure:
<p>
<img src="pathobiome.png">
<p>
Network of microbiome interactions that either (i) suppress or (ii)
favor pathogen establishment and performance. Environmental factors,
such as (clockwise from top left) radiation, precipitation,
temperature, and soil parameters may affect the microbiome directly or
indirectly via the plant host.

<p> As we follow the research roadmap proposed here, we may be
  fortunate, and quickly identify a single novel (or lost) fungal
  endophyte responsible for the sword fern blight.
<p>
  But we may not be so lucky.  The blight may be due to a complex
  and shifting combination of factors, abiotic and biotic, 
  perhaps including interacting insect vectors,
  bacterial pathogenicity islands, quorum sensing,  oomyctes and fungi.

<h3> Case Study 1: Leatherleaf Fern Distortion Syndrome</h3>
<div class="myContent">
It is no surprise that the best recent example of fern disease
research involves an economically valuable species: the primarily
Southern Hemisphere tropical LeatherLeaf Fern, <i>Rumora adiantiformis</i>.
Popular for floral arrangements, it was imported from Florida to Costa
Rica in the 1980's, where it became an important agricultural
export crop.  By the late 90's, the Fern Distortion Syndrome (FDS) was widespread.
<p>
  The following remarks are drawn from two papers:
  <ol>
    <li>
    2010: <a href="https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/PDIS-94-8-0940"
    target="_blank">Fern Distortion Syndrome of Leatherleaf Fern in Costa Rica: Symptoms, Incidence, and Severity</a>
    <li> 2013:
      <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058531"
         target="_blank"> Symptoms of Fern Distortion Syndrome Resulting
         from Inoculation with Opportunistic Endophytic Fluorescent
        Pseudomonas spp</a>
  </ol>

  <h4> A summary of the 2010 paper</h4>
  <ul>
    <p><li> Early studies examined soil physical and
    chemical properties, plant nutrition, insect and nematode
    populations, searched for fungal, bacterial, viral and oomycetes
    infection.  No cause was found, no articles published; only tetrycycline spraying may
    have been mildly effective in reducing symptoms.
        
    <p><li> Growers reported that the syndrome appears to be
    transmitted via rhizomatic propagation, when rhizomes and soils
    are moved to a new growing site.
    <p><li> None of the studies carried out between 1998 and 2004
    identified any single specific pathogen.
    <p><li> For reasons unmention in the 2010 paper, it was decided to
    test rhizomatic population of endophytic fluorescent pseudomonas,
    an endemic Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium.
    <p><li> 2005 sampling protocol tested the hypothesis that
    distorted fronds are associated with reduced growth (small size)
    in rhizomes and roots.  Rhizomes were collected from symptomatic
    and asymptomatic ferns, characterized for vascular discoloration,
    cultured for pseudomonas.
    <p><li> Both scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM,
    TEM) was
    applied to samples from pinnae, rachises, rhizomes and roots,
    apparently to detect "inclusion bodies". 
    <p><li> Rhizomes were tested for dsRNA viral loads.
    <p><li> Rhizomes were tested for increased population of
    pseudomonas in symptomatic vs asymptomatic ferns.
    <p><li> FDS is associated with reduced rhizome diameter and weight.
    <p><li> Streaked and discolored rhizome vascular tissue in symptomatic
        plants, when cultured, produced pseudomonas colonies.
    <p><li> EM revealed no vascular abnormality, no microbes.  Some
    necrosis seen in root vascular bundles, but no microbes.
    <p><li> TEM study of the nuclei of most spongy mesophyll cells
    from young pinnae exhibed large, very granulated nucleoli
    <p><li> Mitochondria of parenchyma and phloem cells shows breakage
    and swelling of the cristae.  Some chloroplasts of these cells had
    aberrant architecture.
    <p><li> Symptomatic plants were enriched for bacteria in
    intercellular spaces of the spongy mesophyll of the pinnae.  No
    fungi were detected in any of the EM work.
    <p><li> PCR viral assays gave no positive result.
    <p><li> Ensuing field work:  culturable pseudomonas found in
    symptomatic ferns at 5 of 6 commercial ferneries.
  </ul>

In followup to the 2010 paper, in the style of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch%27s_postulates"
  target="_blank">Koch Postulates</a>,  Kloepper et al sought to
  reproduce FDS symptoms in healthy greenhouse ferns by innoculating with
  endophytic Fluorescent pseudomonas species.
  <h4> A summary of the 2013 paper</h4>
  <ul>
    <p><li> 29 month greenhouse experiment.
    <p><li> 8x9 randomized complete block experimental design.
    <p><li> virulence genes expressed in a mixed species population
    when those populations reach a minimum level.
    <p><li> 16S rRNA library discriminates successfully among various
    strains of pseudomonas.
    <p><li> Strains derived from the field: clear differences between
    strains found in symptomatic and asymptomatic ferns.
        <p><li> tobacco leaf hypersentivity reaction (HR) proved useful:
            <ul>
              <li>  none of the pseudomonads isolated from inside
 rhizomes of healthy-appearing, asymptomatic plants without a history
                of Benlate use elicited HR in tobacco leaves
              <li> HR was elicited by 77% of the fluorescent
                 pseudomonas isolated from inside rhizomes or from
                  the rhizosphere of diseased, symptomatic ferns
                  within 24–48 hours after inoculation.
              <li>Of these strains, 17% produced the classical HR
 consisting of a dry, brown interveinal necrosis in 24–36 hours, which
                    is an indication that a bacterial strain is pathogenic [6]
              <li> 60% produced a wet, black interveinal
                      necrosis in 48 hours.
                      This black, wet necrosis resembled symptoms of
                      bacterial soft rot caused by pectinolytic
                      enzymes and led us to investigate the frequency
                      of pectinolytic enzyme production via the potato
                      slice maceration test.
                      </ul>
         
  </ul>
  In conclusion, the authors write:

  <ul>
    <p><li> genes for production of virulence factors may move among species of
phylogenetic groups of bacteria in the rhizosphere or inside plants,
and expression of the virulence factors can relate to the population
        density of the bacterial strains.
    <p><li> For example, several virulence
factors have been shown to be regulated by bacterial cell density via
quorum sensing, including elicitation of HR [16], production of IAA
[17], and production of cell wall degrading enzymes including
        pectinase [19], [20].

        <p><li>In addition, quorum sensing regulates both
horizontal gene transfer and bacterial colonization of plant hosts
            [19].
<p><li>     Based upon these reports and our results, we propose the
    following model for how fluorescent pseudomonads cause FDS.

    <p><li>Among the
native population of bacteria in the rhizosphere and inside rhizomes
of healthy ferns are groups of fluorescent pseudomonads, and likely
other eubacterial genera, that contain genes for production of
        virulence and colonization factors.
        <p><li>Perturbations in the growth of
ferns, such as the application of specific systemic fungicides [3],
            trigger population increases of these bacterial groups.
            <p><li>As populations
increase, quorum sensing activates expression of colonization and
virulence factors as well as horizontal transfer of virulence genes to
                other closely related phylogenetic groups.
                <p><li>Over time, there is a shift
in bacterial community inside rhizomes with a concomitant development
of symptoms of FDS. This model is consistent with previous studies
reviewed in Berg et al. [19] that the rhizosphere is a reservoir of
opportunistic pathogens that cause human infections.

The first author on this 2011 paper visited Seward Park's ground
zero c 2016.  He examined affected fronds and suggested that the
symptoms were unlikely to be the result of viral infection.
