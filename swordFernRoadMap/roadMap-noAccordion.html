<h2> A Roadmap For Sword Fern Research </h2>

<p>
For ten years we have watched sword ferns die in Seward Park's 120
acre old-growth forest.  We have mapped and measured this phenomenon
which we call the "sword fern blight".  We have received reports from
elsewhere in the Puget Lowlands.  Preliminary study suggests that the
blight is not caused directly by weather patterns, and may involve a
waterborne pathogen.

<p>
Sustained formal study is now needed.  We propose a sequence of
experiments to identify cause of the sword fern blight - to explain
how these famously robust and long-lived plants are dying at Seward
Park and across the Puget Lowlands of Washington state.

<h3>Current State of Knowledge</h3>

Over the past decade, an enormous amount of knowledge has accrued
regarding the sword fern blight. We are now confident that a pathogen
is responsible for the phenomenon. We have also developed better
documentation of the extent of the blight in Western Washington, the
array of symptoms associated with the blight, and patterns that occur
in areas where there is observable mortality. Below is a summary of
some of the most pertinent findings.

  <h4>Mortality Patterns</h4>
  
<ul>

  <p><li>The symptoms and mortality associated with the blight can spread through sword fern populations over multiple years (personal observation), which suggests that the causal agent is both transmissible and that it is not driven by discrete climate anomalies in any given year.

  <p><li>The spread of the blight within a population can be impeded or slowed by pedestrian trails (personal observation), potentially through the interruption of the spatial continuity of the host plants, and/or through compaction of the soil.
  <p><li>Large mortality events do not appear to be associated with especially dry years.
  <p><li>Mortality is density-dependent â€“ a greater percentage of the sword fern population dies when sword fern cover-abundance is higher (personal observation, analysis of SUNP/EC data). Additionally, there appears to be a cover-abundance threshold around 10% to 12%, below which mortality is low or absent. These findings suggest that the pathogen has limited dispersal ability and that the host plants must be in close proximity for transmission to occur.
  <p><li>In areas where large mortality events have occurred, the likelihood of survival is correlated with proximity to large trees and coarse woody debris (Shannon, 2019).
  <p><li>Co-occurring plant species appear to be unaffected by the blight (personal observation), which suggests that the pathogen is host-specific to sword fern.
  <ul>
    <p><li>Dryopteris species appear to be unaffected by the blight(personal observation). This genus shares the same family as sword ferns (Dryopteridaceae). Dryopteris expansa and Dryopteris filix-mas have both been observed in Seward Park.
  </ul>
  <p><li>Following a large mortality event, the pathogen appears to be unable to induce symptoms in new ferns introduced to the site (Shannon, 2022), which suggests that it may be absent from areas where it was previously transmissible, and suggests that the pathogen is dependent on a living host to persist in the environment.
</ul>

<h4>Morpho-Physiological Symptoms</h4>

<ul>
   <p><li>Foliar symptoms resemble drought stress and range in severity (personal observation):
     <ul>
       <li>Crispate pinnae
       <li>Twisted rachises
       <li>Tip die-back
       <li>Discoloration
    </ul>
  <p><li>Frond production in symptomatic ferns can slowly decrease over multiple years, resulting in asymmetrical quantities of fronds across all cohorts on any given plant (Mendenhall and Barrera, 2021). Additionally, fiddleheads/leaf buds appear to be underdeveloped in symptomatic ferns, or they whither after initially forming.
  <p><li>Symptoms can be experimentally induced (Mendenhall et al., 2019; Shannon, 2022, 2020).
      <ul>
        <li>Results from the greenhouse transmission experiment suggest that the causal agent is likely present in the foliage and can be transmitted through water as a medium.
        <li>Results from the field experiments suggest that the causal agent is unevenly distributed in Seward Park, with greater pathogen pressure in areas where the symptoms and mortality are actively developing in the endemic sword fern population. Additionally, irrigation during the summer does not appear to prevent the development of symptoms. These findings suggest that if seasonal drought stress interacts with the pathogen, it likely acts as a compounding stressor, but by itself does not drive the phenomenon.
      </ul>

      <p><li>During the summer, symptomatic ferns have lower foliar moisture content than apparently healthy ferns even when soil moisture content is similar (Mendenhall and Barrera, 2021).
   </ul>

<h4>Microbiome</h4>

There are significant differences in the composition of the fungal
endophyte communities in the rhizomes of symptomatic ferns compared
with healthy ferns, but no fungal taxa were significantly associated
with the symptomatic ferns (CITATION).


<h3>Knowledge Gaps</h3>

Many knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of the sword fern
blight. Additionally, some of the recent findings have raised new
questions about the ecology of the pathogen.

<ul>
   <p><li> What is the taxonomic identity of the pathogen?
   <p><li> Are other Polystichum species vulnerable to the blight or potential hosts to the pathogen?
   <p><li> How does the pathogen spread?
   <p><li> Is there a cover-abundance or density threshold in sword fern populations that inhibits the spread of the pathogen?
   <p><li> What is the mechanism that allows CWD and large trees to facilitate survival in areas where there is high mortality?
   <p><li> How does the pathogen interfere with water transport in the leaves?
   <p><li> Are the ferns that survive large mortality events resistant to the pathogen?
</ul>
