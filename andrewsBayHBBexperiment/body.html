<h3 style="margin:10px"> Andrews Bay HBB Removal Experiment </h3>

We have worked on this small project intermittently, with help from
Leo Shannon and Irene Munger, over the last two years, starting in the
summer of 2018, with planting and mulching complete in April 2020.
<p>
All of the plants put in withing 10 feet of the shore are dead and
gone, likely a consequence of yachters using this area, now that it is
cleared of blackberries, for embarking and disembarking small craft.
<p>
I water the remaining plants about every two weeks using water carried
from the lake in a bucket.

<h3>Overview, with dinghy, many plants already dead and gone(July 2020):</h3>
I cannot find <i>before</i> photos.  In their plance, imagine the
mulched ground beyond the turquoise pipe entirely filled with
blackberries to a height of three feet.

<h3>Left Side (July 2020):</h3>
Looking up from the lake and to the left.  This area was grubbed, but
not so thoroughly as the right side.  Occasional HBB sprouts appear; I
inermittently do followup grubbing here.
