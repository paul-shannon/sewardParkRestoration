  Western Hemlocks in Seward Park's Old-Growth forest have been in decline and dying 
  for more than a decade.  Other aspects of the forest are also suffering, sword ferns most
  promimently.  The pace of overall forest decline is quickening.  We wish
  to understand this, bring it to the public's attention, raise money for research, and
  slow or remedy the decline.

<p> In July and August of 2021, the Friends of Seward Park (FoSP) joined forces with
    <a href="https://choose180.org" target="_blank">CHOOSE 180</a> a program which supports young people who
    are disproportionately impacted by the criminal justice system in King County.  We spent six
    weeks measuring, mapping and assessing Western Hemlock tree health in the forest at Seward Park.
    Seattle's Department of Neighborhoods provided a small grant for youth salaries.
    A few small pro bono donations of time and equipment were helpful.    With microscope work in the lab
    we may have identified a novel causal agent. See this
    <a href="https://southseattleemerald.com/2021/09/04/the-unlikely-partnership-supporting-south-seattle-youth-through-forest-science/"
       target="_blank">article</a> in September's South Seattle Emerald and microscope videos
    in <a href="#furtherReading">Further Reading</a> below.

<p>The Hemlock study is the most recent of several FoSP projects addressing forest health over the
  last decade.  Each has been run on a shoe-string budget with the pro bono advice (and sometimes
  lab work) of forest ecologists and plant pathologists, each aimed at understanding the decline of this
  old-growth forest.

<p>Citizen science has virtues.  And limits.  It is clear to us now that forest decline at Seward is too
  complex, and its regional consequences too important, to be left to citizen scientists alone.
  Seattle Parks does not have the budget for sustained, peer-reviewed research.  Other regional agencies -
  Washingtion Department of Natural Resources, the US Forest Service among others - have not as yet shown
  any interest in the decline of the non-economic species we describe here.  We must look
  elsewhere.

  <p>
  Therefore in this document we propose:
  <ul>
    <li> That this strategy of doing science on the cheap, led by amateurs &mdash; of whom the present author is
        one &mdash; has reached its natural conclusion.  We do not propose an end to citizen science at
      Steward.   We DO propose an end to citizen-only science.   Future collaborations with
      youth in the region, and with CHOOSE180 in particular, will be especially welcome.  

    <li> That this 100 acre forest, with 100 massive Douglas Firs, Red Cedars and a few surviving
        big Hemlocks, is worth preserving on its own terms, for its own sake, and for all of
      its many visitors.  

      <li> That Seward's old-growth forest, with an unusually dramatic combination of forest
       decline symptoms, provides an ideal study site - a canary in the coalmine for lowland PNW
       forests.  It captures regional forest trends which are more diffuse and harder to study
       elsewhere.  An effective research strategy would focus on Seward's forest decline with
       judicious inclusion of forest studies elsewhere in the region and state.

      <li> To emulate several examples of funded, peer-reviewed academic research
        found below in <a href="#exemplaryRelatedResearch">Exemplary Related Research</a>.

      <li> To make a short, potent video capturing the gravity of the forest's decline.  Most visitors
        to the forest fail to register fern and hemlock decline and death.  This video will seek
        to remedy that, and to build a basis of both concern and support from which
        to attract funding for serious sustained research.
        
  </ul>

  <center><h4>Western Hemlock Decline Is Not Yet Understood</h4></center> The hemlock die-off and
        decline appear to be caused by a combination of native (or introduced) pathogens, and
        established fungal species whose virulence may be amplified by recent heat and drought.
        Hemlock decline has been observed elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest, but it is especially
        severe at Seward Park, where now few hemlocks are expected to survive.  Northern areas of
  the forest are most affected, with southerly areas quickly catching up, as can be seen
  in the map at the  top of this document. This foundational member of the late succession
        forest community, the Washington state tree, is disappearing from Seward as we watch.
        <p>

          Our diseased PNW Western Hemlocks do not exhibit a typical drought-related phenotype.
          Othere regional trees affected by drought - Western Red Cedar, for instance - typically
          lose leaves and needles starting at the top, with lower branches intact.  The hemlocks are
          losing needles from the bottom.  It may then be that recent increases in summer drought
          are not the dominant cause.  Forest pathologist Dr. Bob
          Edmonds <a href="Bob_Edmonds_pathogen_report_new.html" target="_blank">describes</a>
          several well-known fungal challenges to hemlocks, but we do not yet understand their role
          in Seward's current dramatic die-off.

          <center><h4>Seward's <i>Other</i> Die-Off: the Sword Ferns</h4></center>

      <div style="margin: 20px;">

        Since 2014 sword fern decline and die-off has ravaged large parts of the understory at
        Seward.  The history, our experiments, maps and literature can be found on our
        <a href="http://sewardparkswordferndieoff.blogspot.com/">blog</a>.
        The die-off continues unabated today; large areas formerly dominated by sword ferns
        are especially vulnerable.  Dis-off been documented at many other sites in the region,
        on the Kitsap Peninsusla, and on and around Cougar Mountain.  Our
        <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/citizen-scientists-are-still-trying-to-figure-out-why-seattles-sword-ferns-are-disappearing/"
        target="_blank">preliminary experiments</a> suggest a water-borne pathogen.

        <p>

        Many acres of Seward's forest which were once covered by waist-high ferns are now bare.  One
        might hope for natural regeneration in these areas, but this depends upon direct sunlight to
        drive growth, as see in the wake of fire, flood, logging or arboreal insect damage.  Seward's tree
        canopy, however, is mostly intact, and little direct sunlight strikes the ground.  
        A few Fringecups have appeared, along with a single patch of Enchanter's
        Nightshade.  No other natural regeneration has occured in six years.

        <p>  
        Seattle Parks, and their able staff, fund and manage restoration projects at Seward.  Their
        support and counsel for our research efforts has been, and remains, indispensable.
        But the problem &mdash; these twin die-offs &mdash; outpace our joint efforts at restoration.  
        The ecological fabric here has been torn.  We fear that this creates a context in which other
        destabilizing events are now more likely to occur.

         <center><h4>Proposed: Seward's Old-Growth Forest as a Laboratory for Regional Forest Decline</h4></center>


        Forest decline presents at Seward Park earlier and more severely than elsewhere in the
         region.  This is happening in the context of well-documented regional - and indeed global -
         forest decline.  (See <a href="#furtherReading">Further Reading</a> below.)  But while
         global and regional problems are hard to address, dramatic local phenomena are amenable to
         close study. Thus Seward's decline offers an opportunity.


          <p>Just as oncologists first run biopsies on a patient's most aggressive and accessible tumors,
          so might ecologists wish to study aggressive, dramatic and conveniently located forest
          decline.  Dr. Bob Edmonds, UW Professor of Forest Pathology and Ecology (emeritus) used
          Seward in exactly this way for many years.  Thus insight into regional disease processes
          can be found at Seward.  These insights, and possible remedies, would benefit the region,
          advance our knowledge of the interplay of forest disease processes and climate change, and
          - not least - contribute to the survival of this rare and beautiful urban old growth
          forest.

          <p>"Save the Whales!" &mdash; or Elephants or Redwoods.  Slogans like this have inspired
           conservation efforts by focusing on <i>charismatic</i>
           species, animals or plants which are large, threatened, and  which capture the
           imagination.   When money is raised, scientific analysis carried out, and remedies
           devised, matters abstruse, arcane and uncharismatic may become the focus.  But the work
           is motivated by, focused and funded by community interest in the charismatic species.
   
          <p> PNW forest decline is not charismatic.  It is geographically diffuse and easy to
            overlook.  By contrast, Seward's urban old-growth forestis visited and beloved by many.
            It is large, threatened, and captures the imagination of those who visit.  It is a
            charismatic place which also presents, in dramatic and advanced form, the problems of
            regional forest decline.  "Save Seward's Old-Growth Forest!" - and get the jump on
            regional forest decline - could be a powerful call to action.

          <p>We propose in-depth long-term study of forest decline - centered at, but not
            limited to Seward Park.  Schmitz Preserve Park in West Seattle, another urban old-growth
            forest, also has some hemlock decline, and a very different water regime, with
            year-round streams.  Further insight would be gained by including at least some study
            at St. Edward's State Park, Mercer Island's Pioneer Park, King County's Cougar Mountain
            Regional Wildland Park, the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River, and any number of
            other old-growth or mature second-growth lowland forests in Washington state.


            <center><h4><a name="waterDeficit"></a>Questions of Water and Heat</h4></center>

        <p>There is only one seasonal stream at Seward.  Before Lake Washington was lowered in 1916,
        there may have been more.  So Seward's fragility may be due to a century of decreased water
        supply due to the lowered water table, perhaps compounded by a (speculative) loss of
        transport of water up from the lake after the paving of the circumferential lower loop road
        in mid-twentieth century.   At present, this is only conjecture:  we have no evidence of a long-term, broad-based
       forest ecosystem weakening linked to historical water levels and transport.
        <p>
        With regard to sword ferns specifically:  UCSC researcher <a href="https://www.eeb.ucsc.edu/about/dept-directory.php?uid=jpitterm"
        target="_blank">Jarmila Pittermann's</a> studies of water transport and drought stress in
        plants is germane.
        Pittermann has published a number of studies on ferns, and one in particular on sword ferns and drought:
        <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.13770" target="_blank">Not dead yet: the seasonal water relations of two perennial
          ferns during California's exceptional drought</a>.  Her findings, in simplified form, are
        that P. munitum is well-adapted to summer drought stress, and recovers quickly when the
        rains return, recovering even during successive years of California's extreme drought in the
        middle years of the last decade.   PNW drought has been much milder, and sword fern die-off
        is in fact uncorrelated, having appeared first on the Kitsap Peninsula in 2010, well
        before (less) extreme weather appeared in the PNW.
        <p>
          With regard to the Western Hemlock, we urge caution regarding drought hypotheses.
          The pattern of needle loss (bottom-to-top) may indicate that water shortage is not
          the driving factor in needle loss.  Top-to-bottom needle loss tied to drought is
          easily seen at Seward and regionally in Western Red Cedar, and is perhaps the expected
          effect of drought.  Alternatively, hemlocks may sacrifice lower branch needles when
          water supply is low - we simply do not know.
          <p>
        Intriguingly, but anecdotally, we acquired some small evidence of heat effects in August.
        Hand-held microscopy videos of branch tips (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWNzMz4QSB0vTOI78ufPiWlaEtzqELRWE"
        target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWNzMz4QSB0vsX24wuE2_TGcuWmu2cHpF"
        target="_blank">here</a>) show that fungal residue on branch tips is apparently anti-correlated to
          tree health.  Perhaps by chance, we saw this contrast disappear in our samples when Seattle
          temperatures dropped by 25 degrees F. between the date of collection and the date of transport to WSU:
          the black substance that had covered branch tips disappeared, the branch tips becoming smooth and green.
        

         <p> UW plant physiologist Liz Van Volkenburgh suggests the importance of
          studying water/soil/biota relations, and intriguingly proposes to reverse the conclusion
          we offered in 2019 in a
        <a href="https://sewardparkswordferndieoff.blogspot.com/2019/09/is-there-pattern-to-10-survival-at.html"
        target="_blank">detailed fern-by-fern study</a> of the 10% survival of 200 ferns at Ground Zero,
          the initial dramatic die-off site at Seward Park.  We found that survival was significantly
        higher near large trees in this quarter acre, and proposed that hydraulic support from
        those trees increased the observed fern survival.  Liz points out that soil is often locally dry around large
        trees, and that any protective effect might be due to <i>reduced</i> water in the soil in
        the vicinity of the surviving ferns, and a consequent decrease in the spread of the presumed pathogen.
        There are important questions here, as yet unexplored.
        <p>
            

          <center><h4>Some Informal Regional Comparisons</h4></center>
          
          This simple table is the product of a few hours spent at each of three urban forests.
          It suggests that Seward's declines are  more dramatic than elsewhere.  Any
          investment in research into forest decline at Seward stands to benefit these other,
          as yet unaffected (or less affected) urban forests, as well as more remote forests
          throughtout the region.

      <center>
      <img src="urbanForestSurveyTable-2.png" width=60%>
      </center>
        
      <center><h4>Some Possible Research Topics</h4></center>

      We offer these as early-stage suggestions only.  If sufficient funds can be raised, then a
      traditional request for proposals can be issued, a scientific advisory board convened,
      and a variety of research proposals entertained, with a focus on proximal mechanisms of
      plant disease and on background contributing factors.  A list of related and relevant
      published studies, found below, illustrate the depth and style of field and laboratory
      research which may prove helpful at Seward and other forest parks in the region.

      <ul>
        <p><li> The sword fern die-off is most visible, at Seward and elsewhere, in areas previously <i>dominated</i> by ferns, where
            survival is about 10%.   In mixed species understory, some regions are heavily affected,
            other areas lightly, some not at all.   In a few more years, perhaps the spread will
            have reached its maximum at Seward.  This trajectory has not yet been characterized.
            Once mapped, it may provide causal insight.

       <p><li> We have preliminary results which suggest, but do not confirm, a water-borne
                pathogen may be the proximal cause in the sword fern die-off.  This, and other
                proximal causes need to be explored.

       <p><li> Similarly for the Western Hemlock decline, though more tentatively: symptoms of
           a possible thermophilic fungus have been observed, whose nature and causal status are quite
           unknown.  Even if discarded,  or explained as a result rather than a cause of tree death,
           may provide an entry point for careful field and laboratory study, and the generation of hypotheses.

       <p><li> WSU Puyallup's Joseph Hulbert is actively studying PNW forest decline, with a
               particular emphasis on western red cedar.   Hulbert's research and methods may provide
           ideas for related study, and opportunities to collaborate.  

      <p><li> Once proximal causes of sword fern and hemlock are identified, studies of contributing
               environmental factors becomes possible:   hydrology, soil studies, mycorrhizal
          associations, insect herbivory, pollution, local variation of decline intensity.
          These may, in turn, suggest remedial measures.
              
      </ul>


            <center><h4>Summary</h4></center>

        The dramatic decline of sword fern and hemlock &mdash; two long-lived, important species
        &mdash; bodes ill for the forest.  Other ecosystem disruptions are likely to follow due to
        the ecosystem holes created by their decline, or to further climate effects, or
        both.

        <p>
          Seward's ongoing decline is a tragedy.
        <p>
          But it is also an opportunity.
        <p>
          Our citizen science has documented two die-offs, and in each case, we have found
          preliminary evidence of possible pathogens.  If we citizens had been able to pursue those
          leads, and if we had succeeded, the loss of ferns on Tiger Mountain, and in many parts of
          the Kitsap Peninsula <i>might</i> have been prevented.  Future loss of hemlocks in urban
          and rural PNW forests likewise <i>might</i> be limited by remedies which could emerge from
          careful analysis of the dying trees at Seward.
        <p>
          But we do not have that capacity.  We need peer-reviewed university research, sustained over
          several years, which typically costs $100k per year.

        <p> On a small budget, Seattle Parks and the Green Seattle Partnership - led by plant
          ecologists Michael Yadrick and Lisa Cieko - have run valuable projects to restore native
          plants into the areas left bare by the sword fern die-off.  Two small studies addressing
          fern mortality were done, but neither was conclusive, and neither were peer-reviewed.
          Given their constraints - small budgets and their many other complex responsibilities,
          this outcome is not suprising.  It highlights the need for funding at a much higher level.

        <p> With extraordinaty contributions from the community, the Friends of Seward Park
          raised $300k to build the
          <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sewardparktorii/home/seward-park-torii-story" 
            target="_blank">Seward Park Japanese Torii</a>, a decade-long effort, 
          recently completed.   We hope to replicate this success, finding similar generositiy
          from the community, local businesses and granting agencies - to comprehend and
          perhaps remedy the forest decline at Seward and the region.

        <p> As with Seattle Parks, regional governmental agencies have thus far been unable to
        provide such funds.
            
        <p> The decline of the Eastern Hemlock is instructive. Caused by the invasive wooly adelgid,
          it has been much studied, and two strategies to fight the problems have emerged.
          As a stopgap measure, individual trees are treated with
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidacloprid", target="_blank">imidacloprid</a> every
          four or five years.   The second strategy, biocontrol by the Asian beetle,
          <i>Sasajiscymnus tsugae</i> is currently underway at some sites in the Appalachians, with some
          <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/dff209-focusnps1.htm"
             target=_"blank">success</a>.  

        <p>
          Western Hemlock decline is apparently due to other causes, though wooly adelgid is
          sometimes found on our trees.  But nonetheless Eastern Hemlock adelgid studies and
          remedies are relevant here because they demonstrate that careful study and ample
          funding can sometimes identidy precise causes and effects and lead to remedies.

        <p> It is tempting to attribute sword fern and hemlock decline to climate change.
          Changes in the temperature regime, and in the distribution of rainfall throughout the
          year may indeed be factors.   For the ferns,
          <a href="http://sewardparkswordferndieoff.blogspot.com/2020/08/is-die-off-principally-caused-by.html"
             target="_blank">substantial evidence</a> exists suggesting that neithter drought nor
          temperature are direct causes.  Careful research into the actual mechanisms of decline,
          and into possible remedies, is needed.  Similarly for the hemlocks:  we need to understand
          the proximal mechanisms of their decline.
             
          <center><h3>Coda</h3></center>

          Seattle's Department of Neighborhoods granted us, The Friends of Seward Park, $4500 to
          hire, teach and work with three interns from CHOOSE 180,  all pictured above.  Without that
          funding; without guidance from Drs. Tim Billo, Marianne
          Elliott, Bob Edmonds and Joey Hulbert; without the
          support of CHOOSE 180 staff; and especially, without the competence and eagerness of the
          young interns, we would not have learned the actual details of hemlock decline and death
          at Seward Park.

        <p>
          In our communities, especially in recent years, many citizens are working hard to
          understand and, where possible,  to remedy the lingering effects of American historical inequities and
          injustice.  We saw in this project that there are few remedies as powerful as a good job
          and meaningful work.  We now hope to find the funds to do rigorous research on Seward's
          forest decline, and by natural extension, into current and looming forest decline elsewhere.
          We also hope that young people from many communities will join in this work - for their
          benefit, and not least, for the benefit of the science we undertake, and to the broader community.
