<h3> Seward Park and Regional Forest Decline - What's Next?</h3>
     <div style="margin: 20px;">
       <a href="https://choose180.org" target="_blank">CHOOSE 180</a> interns spent six weeks
       in Seward Park's old-growth <br>forest documenting the dramatic decline and death of Western Hemlock

        Seward's hemlock die-off and decline are likely caused by a combination of native (or
        introduced) pathogens whose virulence is amplified by recent heat and drought.    Hemlock
        decline has been observed elsewhere in the PNW, but it is especially severe at Seward
        Park, where few hemlocks are expected to survive.  This foundational member of the late
        succession forest community, in a rare urban old-grown forest, is disappearing as we watch.
        <p>
        Drought-affected trees - red cedars, for instance - typically lose leaves and needles from
        the top.  The hemlocks are losing needles from the bottom, suggesting that unknown processes
        may be at work.
        <p>This summer the Friends of Seward Park joined with CHOOSE 180, supported by a small grant from
        the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods, to do some science in the woods.  We observed
         closely, took careful measurements, created a public record.

        <p> The hemlock die-off is happening against the backdrop of other problems at Seward, and
          in the context of well-documented regional - and indeed global - forest decline.
          (See <a href="#furtherReading">Further Reading</a> below.)  But while global and regional
          problems are hard to address, dramatic local phenomena are amenable to close study.

          <p>Just as oncologists run biopsies on a patient's most aggressive and prominent tumors,
          so might ecologists wish to study aggressive, dramatic and conveniently located forest
          decline.  Insight into regional disease processes can be found at Seward.
          These insights, and possible remedies, would benefit the region, advance our knowledge of
          the interplay of forest disease processes and climate change, and - not least - contribute to the survival
          of this rare and beautiful urban old growth forest.

        Sword fern die-off has ravaged the understory at Seward, with very little subsequent natural
        regeneration.  The die-off has been documented at many regional sites, especially on the
        Kitsap Peninsula and the Issaquah Alps. Early experiments suggest a water-borne pathogen.

     <h3> A Proposal </h3>
    </center>

      <div style="margin: 20px;">
        Forest decline presents at Seward Park earlier and more severely than elsewhere in the
        region.  There is only one seasonal stream at Seward.  Before Lake Washington was lowered in
        1916, there may have been more.  So Seward's fragility may be due to a century of decreased
        water supply, perhaps abetted by transport lost with the paving of the lower loop road.
        This 100 acre forest, with 100 massive Douglas Firs, Red Cedars and a few
        surviving big Hemlocks, is a rare remnant of the million acres of regional precolonization
        primeval forest.
        <p>
        The dramatic decline of these two long-lived, important species bodes ill for the forest: other
        ecosystem disruptions are likely to follow, due to the ecosystem holes that fern and hemlock
        death creates, or to further climate effects, or both.
        <p>
          Seward's ongoing decline is a tragedy.
        <p>
          But it is also an opportunity.
        <p>
          Our citizen science has documented two die-offs, and in each case, we have found evidence of
          possible pathogens.  If we citizens had been able to pursue those leads, and if we had succeeded,
          the loss of ferns on Tiger Mountain, and in many parts of the
          Kitsap Peninsula <i>might</i> have been prevented.  Future loss of hemlocks in urban and
          rural PNW forests likewise <i>might</i> be limited by remedies which could emerge from
          careful analysis of the dying trees at Seward.
        <p>
          But we do not have that capacity.  We need peer-reviewed university research, sustained over
          several years, which typically costs $100k per year.
        <p>
          Regional governmental agencies have been  unable to provide such funds.  Philanthropy
          and public donations are needed.
        <p>
          The decline of the Eastern Hemlock is instructive. Caused by the inasive wooly adelgid,
          it has been much studied, and two strategies to fight the problems have emerged.
          As a stopgap measure, individual trees are treated with
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imidacloprid", target="_blank">imidacloprid</a> every
          four or five years.   A Japanese biocontrol beetle, <i>Sasajiscymnus tsugae</i> has
          been released in the Appalachians with some
          <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/dff209-focusnps1.htm"
             target=_"blank">success</a>.
        <p>
          Western Hemlock decline is apparently due to other causes, though wooly adelgid is
          sometimes seen on our trees.  Eastern Hemlock strategies are relevant here because
          they demonstrate that careful study and ample funding can sometimes reveal precise cause
          and effect and lead to remedies.  Inasmuch as the sword fern die-off is appears to be
          <a href="http://sewardparkswordferndieoff.blogspot.com/2020/08/is-die-off-principally-caused-by.html"
          target="_blank">unconnected to climate change</a>, it is especially here that the
          provisional success of efforts in the Appalachians are relevant.

          Seattle's Department of Neighborhoods granted us, The Friends of Seward Park, $4500 to
          hire, teach and work with three interns from CHOOSE 180 all pictured above.  Without that
          funding; without guidance from Drs. Tim Billo, Bob Edmonds and Joey Hulbert; without the
          support of CHOOSE 180 staff; and especially, without the competence and eagerness of the
          young interns, we would not have learned the actual details of hemlock decline and death
          at Seward Park.
        <p>
          In our communities, especially in recent years, many citizens are workng hard to
          understand and, where possible,  to remedy the lingering effects of American historical inequities and
          injustice.  We saw in this project that there are few remedies as powerful as a good job
          and meaningful work.  We now hope to find the funds to do rigorous research on Seward's
          forest decline, and by natural extension, into current and looming forest decline elsewhere.
          We also hope that young people from many communities will join in this work - for their
          benefit, and not least, for the benefit of the science we undertake.
