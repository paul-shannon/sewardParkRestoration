<i> Dr. Robert Edmunds taught tree disease seminars to arborists for many years, using Seward Park's
  old-growth forest as his laboratory.   There is no one better versed on this topic, and in this
  place. We are grateful to Bob for his guidance and support.</i>

Last summer [2021], I walked in several parks in Seattle (Seward, Lincoln, and North Acres), Shoreline
  (Hamlin and Shoreview), and Lake Forest Park (Grace Cole Nature area).
<p>
  
  Root diseases are very common in all these parks:
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5187461.pdf"
    target="_blank">Phellinus sulphurascens</a>: laminated root rot
    <li> <a href="https://apps.fs.usda.gov/r6_decaid/views/heterobasidion_root_disease.html"
    target="_blank"> Heterobasidion root and butt rot</a>: annosus root disease
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaeolus_schweinitzii" target="_blank">Phaeolus
    schweintzii</a>: velvet-top fungus
  </ul>

<p>
All the parks have active laminated root rot. It is particularly active in Douglas-fir and causing a
lot of mortality in trees  older than 80 years.  Phellinus is present in younger trees in Seward Park. Older
Douglas-fir trees in Seward and Lincoln Parks have a lot of Phaeolus schweinitzii. You don't
normally see much Phaeolus in younger trees.

<p>
<a href="https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/madrone-arbutus-menziesii-canker"
target="_blank">Madrone canker</a> is very prominent in each park. Phellinus is also active in
Pioneer Park on Mercer Island and Beaver Lake Park in Sammamish. I have not seen the amount of
mortality in western hemlock at Seward Park in any of the other parks, perhaps because hemlock is
not well represented. However, I haven't visited all these parks recently.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterobasidion_occidentale" target="_top">Heterobasidion
occidentale</a> does occur in western hemlock.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillaria"
target="_blank">Armillaria</a> does occur but not at the scale of the others. It is mostly in trees
adjacent to trails. Western redcedar has some stem decay.

<p>
Climate change is no doubt creating stress in all the tree species mentioned above, especially
western redcedar. This stress makes them more susceptible to diseases. Susceptibility to Armillaria
increases with tree stress. Armillaria is capable of causing root disease in all of the tree
species. Climate change might explain the foliage disease in hemlock. Madrone is also dying from
madrone canker in all the parks.

<p>
                                                                                 
So all these diseases and mortality are causing rapid change in the forests in these parks. Species
composition is changing with time.  The natural successional sequence in these forest after a
disturbance like fire and windthrow would be red alder, Douglas-fir and then hemlock. Diseases are
having a big effect on succession. Douglas-fir forests are being set back to hardwoods like alder,
vine maple, and poplar. it will be hard to regenerate Douglas-fir because it needs a big disturbance
and lots of light. This why it does well in clearcuts. The forest could also move forward to hemlock
and western redcedar, but hemlock prefers to regenerate on coarse woody debris (logs) and there may
not be enough. Cedar can handle a wide variety of light conditions.
<p>
                                                                                 

So you may ask what type of forest you want in the future in these parks. Knowing about forest
succession and how much disease there is on the different tree species you might be able to predict
what the forests might look in the future and how to manage them. Not all the conifers will die, but
the forests will change with time. It will probably be different in each park. Climate change will
have a big influence.
