     <h3> Forest Decline in Seward Park and Other Regional Forest Parks: Proposed Research</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4> 

      The dramatic decline of two long-lived central species in the urban old-growth forest in
      Seattle's Seward Park raises concerns about this forest's future.  Sword fern
      (Polystichum munitum) and Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) have suffered signficant loss in
      the last decade.  Sword fern mortality is 90% in previously dominant areas, and about 50%
      in mixed understory, with more the 75% of Seward's 100 acres affected.  Hemlock mortality
      approaches 100% in the most progressed regions, with total loss possible in the next decade.
      The precise mechanisms of mortality are not known; climate effects are
      at least peripherally involved.  Further overall forest decline is likely due to ecosystem
      holes created by the decline of these two (and other) species, due to the possibility of
      introduced pathogens, and to further climate effects.

   <p> Seward's forest is a mix of early (200-350 years) and fully developed (400-600 years) old-growth.
     Occupying about 100 acres, it is a rare remnant of the approximately 1 million acres of
     pre-colonisation Puget Lowland forest.  It is is classified by its dominant species: Douglas
     Fir, Western Hemlock, Western Red Cedar, Dwarf Oregon Grape, Salal and Sword Fern.  Other
     common trees are Red Alder, Pacific Madrone, Black Cottonwood and Oregon Ash.  The shrub layer
     is dominated by Osoberry, Beaked Hazelnut, Ocean Spray, Red and Evergreen Huckleberry, and Vine
     Maple.

    <p>Seattle Parks ecologists characterize Seward's forest using codes for  four
     species <b><i>PSME-TSHE/MANE-POMU</b></i>.  These implicitly make the case for the importance
     of the decline we address:
     
     <ul>
       <li> <b>PSME</b>: Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)
       <li> <b>TSHE</b>: <u>Western Hemlock</u> (Tsuga heterophylla)
       <li> <b>MANE</b>: Dwarf Oregon Grape (Mahonia nervosa)
       <li> <b>POMU</b>: <u>Sword Fern</u> (Polystichum munitum)
     </ul>

   <p> If not reversed, these losses are tragic.  This rare urban old-growth forest, loved and visited
     by many, the "crown jewel of Seattle's park system" is degrading as we watch.

     These losses also provide an opportunity.  Though neighboring urban, exurban and regional
     forests show some of the same symptoms,  nowhere else are they as concentrated and dramatic.
     Seward Park's forest provides an ideal laboratory to study regional forest decline.

   <p> We present here several years of citizen science and pro bono research into the declines.
     Citizen science, and unfunded pro bono research, both have virtues.  And limits.  It is clear
     to us now that forest decline at Seward is too complex, and its regional consequences too
     important, to be left to such efforts alone.  We make the case for multi-year funding for
     academic research, awarded through competitive grants, and leading to peer-reviewed research.
     Seattle Parks does not have the budget for sustained, peer-reviewed research.  Other regional
     agencies - Washingtion Department of Natural Resources, the US Forest Service among others -
     have not as yet shown any interest in the decline of the non-economic species we describe here.
     We must look elsewhere.
     
<h4> Forest Health Problems in Seattle Area Forest Parks: Tree diseases, Global Warming, Drought</h4>

Pacific Northwest forest trees live in constant dynamic interplay with a variety of mostly well
understood, mostly fungal pathogens: a full list is provided
<a href="https://pshannon.net/nextSteps/Bob_Edmonds_pathogen_report_new.html"
target="_blank">here</a>.  Trees regularly succumb to these diseases, at ages and with frequencies within a
stand as part of the natural progression of the forest.  Decayed and dead trees support a large
community of species; they are integral members of the healthy forest ecosystem.  In healthy
forests, a rough equilibrium evolves between pathogens and host trees.
   <p>
It appears that in recent decades this equilibrium has been disturbed.  The istoric Mediteranean
climate weather patterns the Pacific Northwest have changed, with some years of unusual drought
(2015) and heat (2021).  [references needed].  Novel pathogens from distant regions of the planet
may have been introduced to Seattle, a global trade, commerce and travel hub.  Some combination of
these factors has created an unusal amount of mortality in PNW forests, with these effects most
dramatically evident in Seward Park's old-growth forest.

   <p>
Forest decline is reported elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest, and throughout the western 
United States.  Seward’s early old-growth forest presents an especially dramatic instance of 3 4
this decline, perhaps due to the rare juxtaposition of old-growth and a variety of urban stress
factors.
     

<h4> The 2021 Hemlock Study</h4>
Western Hemlock trees in Seward Park's 100 acre old-growth forest appear to be diseased and
dying in unusual numbers.  Changes in a forest can be overlooked. They can be exaggerated. Longitudinal data, collected
year upon year by an explicit protocol is the remedy. Such data reveals the actual dynamics of
the forest, setting the stage for discerning the mechanisms at play, and providing a basis for
possible strategic responses. The Friends of Seward Park teamed up with CHOOSE 180 (a private non-profit organization which
supports young people in King County disproportionately impacted by the criminal justice
system) to gather preliminary data on this phenomenon.
   <p>
     
Three paid interns (DON grant O21019) and one volunteer supervisor surveyed 116 western
hemlocks, working four afternoons a week for six weeks in July and early August of 2021. We
developed measurement and sampling protocols in consultation with Drs. Marianne Elliott, Tim
Billo and Joseph Hulbert (WSU and UW). We curated data from field notes into a spreadsheet
format which are now archived in several version: an interactive map and data table, an excel
spreadsheet, an iNaturalist project. 24% of the trees are fully dead, 7% appear to be in good
health, 69% are in various stages of decline. The decline and die-off is noticeably more severe
in the north-central, formerly hemlock-dense survey area, and mildest towards the south,
suggesting a possible north-south progression of the phenomenon. This distribution may be
seen in the following map, which also illustrates one step in the interns determination of tree
height.  The most affected northern region, about 0.1 hectare, is captured
in the accompanying photograph.   The full final report presented to Seattle Parks can be found
