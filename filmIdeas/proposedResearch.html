     <h3> Forest Decline in Seward Park and Other Regional Forest Parks: Proposed Research</h3>

      <h4>Overview</h4> 

      The dramatic decline of two long-lived central species in the urban old-growth forest in
      Seattle's Seward Park raises concerns about this forest's future.  Sword fern
      (Polystichum munitum) and Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) have suffered signficant loss in
      the last decade.  Sword fern mortality is 90% in previously dominant areas, and about 50%
      in mixed understory, with more the 75% of Seward's 100 acres affected.  Hemlock mortality
      approaches 100% in the most progressed regions, with total loss possible in the next decade.
      The precise mechanisms of mortality are not known; climate effects are
      at least peripherally involved.  Further overall forest decline is likely due to ecosystem
      holes created by the decline of these two (and other) species, due to the possibility of
      introduced pathogens, and to further climate effects.

   <p> Seward's forest is a mix of early (200-350 years) and fully developed (400-600 years) old-growth.
     Occupying about 100 acres, it is a rare remnant of the approximately 1 million acres of
     pre-colonisation Puget Lowland forest.  It is is classified by its dominant species: Douglas
     Fir, Western Hemlock, Western Red Cedar, Dwarf Oregon Grape, Salal and Sword Fern.  Other
     common trees are Red Alder, Pacific Madrone, Black Cottonwood and Oregon Ash.  The shrub layer
     is dominated by Osoberry, Beaked Hazelnut, Ocean Spray, Red and Evergreen Huckleberry, and Vine
     Maple.

    <p>Seattle Parks ecologists characterize Seward's forest using codes for  four
     species <b><i>PSME-TSHE/MANE-POMU</b></i>.  These implicitly make the case for the importance
     of the decline we address:
     
     <ul>
       <li> <b>PSME</b>: Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)
       <li> <b>TSHE</b>: <u>Western Hemlock</u> (Tsuga heterophylla)
       <li> <b>MANE</b>: Dwarf Oregon Grape (Mahonia nervosa)
       <li> <b>POMU</b>: <u>Sword Fern</u> (Polystichum munitum)
     </ul>

   <p> If not reversed, these losses are tragic.  This rare urban old-growth forest, loved and visited
     by many, the "crown jewel of Seattle's park system" is degrading as we watch.

     These losses also provide an opportunity.  Though neighboring urban, exurban and regional
     forests show some of the same symptoms,  nowhere else are they as concentrated and dramatic.
     Seward Park's forest provides an ideal laboratory to study regional forest decline.

   <p> We present here several years of citizen science and pro bono research into the declines.
     Citizen science, and unfunded pro bono research, both have virtues.  And limits.  It is clear
     to us now that forest decline at Seward is too complex, and its regional consequences too
     important, to be left to such efforts alone.  We make the case for multi-year funding for
     academic research, awarded through competitive grants, and leading to peer-reviewed research.
     Seattle Parks does not have the budget for sustained, peer-reviewed research.  Other regional
     agencies - Washingtion Department of Natural Resources, the US Forest Service among others -
     have not as yet shown any interest in the decline of the non-economic species we describe here.
     We must look elsewhere.
