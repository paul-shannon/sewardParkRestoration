</center>

Seward Park's 120 acre, Douglas Fir, Western Redcedar,
Hemlock <a href="https://ecoshare.info/uploads/ccamp/synthesis_paper_tools/Freund_Franklin_&_Lutz_2015_Structure_of_early_old-growth_Douglas-fir_forests_in_the_PNW.pdf">early
old-growth forest</a> is a rare urban remnant of the million acre Puget Lowland pre-colonisation
forest.  Found along with Oregon Grape, Salal, Evergreen and Red Huckleberry, Baldhip and Nootka
Rose, Ocean Spray and Snowberry, sword ferns were long the dominant understory plant
of this mature forest.

<p>
Since 2014 we have been observing and attempting to understand a dramatic die-off of the sword fern,
Polystichum munitum, in Seward's old-growth.  Beginning in 2013, spreading year by year, by 2020 the
die-offf is found in all sections of the forest, most dramatically in areas where sword ferns
previously dominanted.  (Where the understory is more mixed, fern mortality approached 50%.)
Intermittent reports, some verified, come in from other Puget Lowland locations, from
the <a href="https://paulshannon.shinyapps.io/issaquahAlpsMap/" target="_blank">Issaquah Alps</a>,
the Olympic Peninsula, and from northwest Oregon.


<p>

  Here we provide a historical survey of research, observations and experiments addressing  the
  die-off at Seward Park.  No causal agent has been identified, but drought (a popular hypothesis)
  has been eliminated as the primary cause, and an unknown water-borne pathogen is proposed as
   possibly playing a central role.

<p>
  These reports provide background for an upcoming meeting to strategize the best uses of a
  recent $40k donation.
