</center>

Seward Park's 120 acre, Douglas Fir, Western Redcedar,
Hemlock <a href="https://ecoshare.info/uploads/ccamp/synthesis_paper_tools/Freund_Franklin_&_Lutz_2015_Structure_of_early_old-growth_Douglas-fir_forests_in_the_PNW.pdf">early
old-growth forest</a> is a rare urban remnant of the million acre Puget Lowland pre-colonisation
forest.  Sword fern, Dwarf Oregon Grape, Salal, evergreen and red huckleberry, bald hip and Nootka
rose, Ocean Spray and snowberry dominate the understory.

<p>
Since 2014 we have been observing and attempting to understand a dramatic die-off of the dominant
understory sword fern species, Polystichum munitum, in the 120-acre old growth "Magnificent Forest"
in Seattle's Seward Park. Beginning in 2013, spreading year by year, and by 2020 found in all
sections of the forest.  Intermittent reports, some verified, come in from other Puget Lowland
locations, from the <a href="https://paulshannon.shinyapps.io/issaquahAlpsMap/" target="_blank">Issaquah Alps</a>,
and from northwest Oregon.

<p>

  Here we provide a historical survey of research, observations and experiments addressing  the
  die-off at Seward Park.  No causal agent has been identified, but drought (a popular hypothesis)
  has been eliminated as the primary cause, and an unknown water-borne pathogen is proposed as
   possibly playing a central role.

<p>
  These reports provide background for an upcoming meeting to strategize the best uses of a
  recent $40k donation.
