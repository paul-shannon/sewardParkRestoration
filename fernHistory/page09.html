Without charge, plant pathologist Dr. Ribiero analyzed diseased sword fern samples in
his Bainbridge Island lab, and visited Seward Park to consult with us.
His report:

<blockquote>

I examined the fern samples you brought over. I found a little
Rhizoctonia and Pythium in the roots. Both can cause root rot problems
in ferns. However, I am not convinced that this is the cause of the
problem since both are present in low amounts in the roots.  The
fronds are infected with Glomerella fungus blight. Again, not in
sufficient amounts to cause complete dieback of the frond. No foliar
nematodes (a problem reported on ferns), were isolated from fronds
tested.

<p>

The dieback is more typical of herbicide injury or some other chemical
injury. Was any herbicide applied on this area? [We have no evidence
for, or report of, herbicides applied here.]  Rhizoctonia is a
difficult pathogen to control.
