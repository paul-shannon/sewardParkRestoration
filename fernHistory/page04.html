<center><h3>The Mountain Beaver Hypothesis, Rejected</h3></center>

I do not have ready to hand Tim's final data on this study, with
exclosures and control plots.  But I recall that there was no enriched
survival without the enclosed plots.

Maybe also relevant is that  Sword fern die-off is reliably reported from Mercer Island,
which (we are told) has no mountain beavers
