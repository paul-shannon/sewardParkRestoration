<h3>Seattle Parks contracts for UW Doty Lab Study</h3>

Seattle Parks and the Green Seattle Parntership have for decades provided strong support,
scientific advice, restoration plants and contractor planting, cisterns for summertime watering, and
equipment for the forest at Seward Park.  Most of the work reported on this blog would have been
impossible without their support.  Gillian Weed, Lisa Cieko, and Michael Yadrick have our thanks.

<p>
  
Two primary camps have developed as we all have tried to figure out the cause of, and maybe a remedy
for the sword fern die-off.  As I understand it, Seattle Parks staff favor the view that drought, or
more broadly, climate change, is responsible.  Those of us in the informal "sword fern working
group" are skeptical of the drought hypothesis, and find "climate change" too broad an account to be
useful.  We suggest instead - and we may be proven wrong - that an as yet unknown pathogen plays an
important role.  And whatever the cause/s turn out to be, we are keen to discover the specific
mechanisms of the die-off.

<p>
After receiving a generous donation for sword fern research, Seattle Parks contracted the well-known
and well-regarded UW Doty Lab to analyze the problem.  We were grateful to Parks when they invited
us to review the report, which concluded with an empahsis on the drought hypothesis:

<blockquote>

  Analysis of the sword fern decline sites, as well as our own
  experience in transplanting healthy ferns from an intact forest into
  a plant growth room, suggested that <b><u><i>dry conditions cause sword fern
  decline.</i></u></b> The Pacific Northwest has been experiencing drought
  conditions coincident with the period of fern decline. In the West,
  2011 to 2015 was marked with a longer duration of warm, dry weather,
  and across the Northwest, the year 2015 was listed as an extreme
  drought year with exceptionally low snowpack and higher temperatures
  3, 4. At each of the sites of sword fern decline that we
  investigated, several Pacific NW iconic species were also declining,
  again suggesting that a specific pathogen is not the cause of the
  decline. Projected climate changes affecting western USA include an
  increased frequency of severe drought, reduced snowpack, and hotter
  and drier growing seasons 5.
<P>
  Though no evidence for a pathogen was observed in this study, the
  possibility remains that a pathogen was responsible for some of the
  die back observed at Seward Park. If a pathogen had moved through
  the area, it may have already killed those plants most susceptible
  and currently only remains in the environment in small numbers. <b><u><i>Fern
  plants that others had transplanted into the die-back sites and were
  irrigated appear to be doing well. Without active spread and
  infection, identification of a pathogen is unlikely.</b></u></i> The die back
  observed may also be the result of a combination of factors, with
  environmental stress triggering disease outbreak. Though these
  possibilities exist, it seems unlikely that a novel or virulent
  pathogen is responsible for the die back seen in Seward Park.


</blockquote>

We were (and remain) skeptical of the report's conclusion.  Here are some of our reasons.

<p>
  
First regarding the pathogen:
<ol>
  <li> No pathogen was found in their small experment.  The old cliche is useful here:
      Absence of evidence does not constitute  evidence of absence.
  <li> "[pathogen]" currently remains only in small numbers." In fact, the die-off continues apace.
  <li> "Fern plants that other had planted ... and irrigated appear to be doing well".
    <ul>
      <li> 2 x 12 irrigated nursery ferns are 96% healthy after 3 years at Ground Zero, as predicted
      <li> 50% of 12 irrigated ferns, planted into spreading die-off,  are dead, also as predicted
    </ul>
  <li> "without active spread and infection, identification of a pathogen is unlikely".
    We, by contrast, and with confidence, report active ongoing spread and infection throughout the forest.
    New areas of die-off - some dramatic - are easy to find.

</ol>    

Regarding drought:

<ol>
  <li> Seattle has had average rainfall (39 inches), with normal  variability compared to the
    historical record, over the last forty  years. Summary available from
    the <a href="https://www.seattleweatherblog.com/rain-stats/">Seattle Weather Blog</a>.
  <li> "PNW drought conditions": this phrase lacks precision.
  <li> References to "the West" and "climate changes affecting western USA" are misleading.
  <li> The summer 2015 was unusually dry, though the year had an above average total.  
       But the die-off first appeared at  Seward in 2013, on the Kitsap Peninsula in 2010.
  <li>  UW PhD atomospheric scientist Joe Zagrodnik looked for drought/die-off correlations and reported

    <blockquote>The period from 2007-2012 was generally characterized by near-normal temperatures and precipitation
    (2011 was a cool year). By all measures the current period anomalous weather started in 2013 and I can say
    confidently that anything happening prior to 2013 is not caused by unusually warm or dry weather patterns.

  <li> Caleb Goldstein-Miller, working at Reed College with ecologist Dr. Aaron Ramierez, reports:

  <blockquote> ...the ecophysiology analysis of ferns from healthy, intermediate and die-off areas
    in Seward park [show] that moisture stress is not a driver of physiological stress for Seward ferns.
 </blockquote>
	and
	<blockquote>

        For the ecophysiology analysis portion, our hypothesis was that plants in non-die off areas
        would have higher values for stomatal conductance, Fv/Fm, and possess a ​Psi closer to the
        optimum for the species in question (or further from the turgor loss point for the local
        population) in comparison to plants in active die off areas. Three distinct areas of decline
        were established at Seward Park, die off, intermediate, and healthy. These areas were
        characterized with the help of Paul Shannon (Seward Park Steward) and Olga Kildisheva
        (Verdant Counseling, LLC) and sampled on August 19th, at the peak of the dry season. We used
        the following metrics to compare physiological stress of ferns in the die off, intermediate,
        and healthy treatment areas: dark-adapted fluorescence (Fv/Fm) to determine the efficiency
        of photosystem II, stomatal conductance (Gs) to ascertain whether or not ferns are closing
        their stomata during photosynthetically active periods, and xylem water potential (Psi)​ to
        determine water status (Toivonen and Vidaver, 1988; Schreiber and Bilger, 1987; Corcuera and
        Notivol, 2015; Angelopoulos et al., 1996; Jordan and Ritchie, 1971).
        <p>
	Healthy tissue from ten ferns within each treatment group was analyzed for predawn and
        midday water potential and dark-adapted fluorescence. Stomatal conductance measurements were
        taken in between predawn and midday sampling. We found no significant differences between
        treatment groups in any of the metrics except midday water potential. The ferns from the die
        off treatment area had an average midday xylem water potential of -1.7574 MPa, versus
        -0.9074 MPa and -0.9474 MPa for the intermediate and healthy treatment groups
        respectively.
        <p>
	This result is complicated by the fact that we ran out of compressed nitrogen
        during the midday water potential readings from the die off treatment area. Samples were
        immediately transported from Seward Park to Reed college in a cooler so that water potential
        measurements could still be taken. Due to the unstandardized approach in xylem water
        potential analysis between the die off and the other treatment groups, we cannot be
        confident of the accuracy of this result. However, a pressure-volume curve was created from
        samples taken across the three treatment groups, which gave us a turgor loss point of -2.3
        MPa for ​P. munitum​ at Seward Park. Since the significant water potential result was well
        above this moisture stress-indicating threshold, we are confident in our conclusion that
        moisture stress is not driving the die off at Seward Park. This increases our confidence
        that the regional decline is caused by some still unknown biotic vector.

      <li> Informal observation, and the commonplace experience of PNW gardeners, suggest that sword ferns are an
	   exceptionally hardy species, as confirmed with respect to severe drought by the Pittermann Lab at UCSC,
         in a peer-reviewed 2016 paper in the New Phytologist (a high-impact journal),
	<a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.13770" target="_blank">Not dead yet: the seasonal water relations  of two perennial
	  ferns during California's exceptional drought</a>. Dr. Jarmilla Pittermann summarizes
        <blockquote>
	  The seasonal water relations of P. munitum and D. arguta are variable, but consistent with laboratory-based
	  estimates of drought tolerance. Hydraulic and Psi recovery following rain allows perennial ferns to survive
	  severe drought, but prolonged water deficit, coupled with insect damage, may hamper frond survival. The
	  legacy effects of drought on reproductive capacity and community dynamics are unknown.
        </blockquote>

All concerned might agree that the sword fern die-off involves anthropogenic factors. An introduced
pathogen - as with Eastern Hemlock and American Chestnut - is possible.

<p>
Possiblities as yet untested include fungal disruption, that is, the loss of ecosystem fungi, rather
than the introduction of a pathogen.  Mycelial networks may be disturbed.  As may be a possible
mutualistic foliar endophyte, one which plays a role for ferns similar to that which Rhabdocline parkeri
plays for another long-lived species, the Douglas Fir.

<p>
Perhaps most likely is that multiple causes will ultimately be found.
