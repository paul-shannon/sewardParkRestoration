  <li> Can significant endophyte population differences be detected between pinnnae on healthy
  ferns, and photosynthesizing (apparently healthy) tissue near necrotic tissue on affected
  plants? Younginger et al, 2017:

    <blockquote>

    Because many microfungi can-not be cultivated in vitro,
    culture-based approaches used to exam-ine endophyte communities
    likely underestimate the actual diversity of these microbes within
    plants. Through next-generation sequencing technology—which allows
    for the direct sequencing of environmental samples—we now have the
    ability to detect unculturable taxa, providing opportunities to
    docu-ment previously unseen diversity. However, limitations do
    exist in all NGS platforms employed, and sequence databases for
    fungi are currently biased toward soil-dwelling
    macrofungi. Despite current technical shortcomings, researchers
    have used NGS technology to study microbial diversity across a
    broad range of habitats. Investigations into the microbiota of
    understudied plant lineages using NGS technology should also be
    pursued.
