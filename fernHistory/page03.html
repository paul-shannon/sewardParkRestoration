<center><h3>Lazarus Fern Babies</h3></center>

David Perasso collected spores from the Lazarus Fern, grew out the
gametophytes, Seattle Parks donated greenhouse space.  About 110 of
these Lazarus offspring, now 2+ years old in gallon pots, are ready to
plant out this fall.

  I propose an 
<p>
  Seattle Parks is also providing 100 generic nursery ferns this fall.

<p>
 I hope to plant these ~200 ferns in an experimental design that will
 test for improved survival of the pure Lazarus offspring, on the
 assumption that the Lazarus Fern has a protective allele, and that
 this has been passed on to some of the offspring.

<p>
  I need  advice. I imagine an experiment in which, emulating the 36-fern
 planting experiment:

  <ul>
    <li> Some plants from each group are planted "in harm's way" - in
    a currently unaffected area to which the die-off is moving
    <li> As a control, some of each group are planted into
    now-protected (?) Ground Zero, or nearby.
  </ul>
