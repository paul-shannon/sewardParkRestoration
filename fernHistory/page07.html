<h4>Broad generalizations</h4>


<ol>
  <li> Sword ferns colonize open ground
  <li> Rarely reproduce after forest canopy closes
  <li> Live indefinitely.  Polytichum genus expert, David Barrington:  "1000 years is not out of the question"
  <li> Distribution is not unlike douglas fir, which also colonizes open ground, and does not
    reproduce under a close canopy.
  <li> Long-lived species may benefit, may even require, short-lived symbionts to defend againts
  short-lived (and thus rapidly evolving) pathogens.  Perhaps P.munitum has a symbiont functionally
  equivalent to Rhabdocline parkeri, a ubiquitous foliar endophyte of Douglas-fir.

on Polystichum munitum:

<ol>

  <li>Germination: Fern spores usually germinate only after being
  soaked in water. Spores of western swordfern germinate best when
  exposed to light, but some germination occurs in darkness (review by
  [74]). In the laboratory, western swordfern spore germination rate
  was >20% in light and 2% to 10% in the dark [218].

  <li> Gametophyte establishment and plant growth: Very little
  information was available regarding western swordfern gametophyte
  establishment (as of 2015). One source says that gametophytes are
  extremely rare in western swordfern populations [189]. Another
  source notes that western swordfern and other ferns establish from
  spores on fresh alluvium following deep sediment deposition in
  redwood forests on alluvial terraces; the new alluvium is rich in
  nutrients and is an excellent seedbed [20].

  <li> Vegetative regeneration: Vegetative reproduction in western
  swordfern is limited [189]; it can regenerate from rhizomes after
  top-kill but does not spread vegetatively. Fronds have determinant
  growth and do not grow back. New fronds emerge from rhizomes early
  each growing season [35] and after top-kill or removal. Heavy
  cropping of western swordfern does not reduce cover for long; new
  fronds quickly regain cover after old ones have been removed [199].

  <li> Western swordfern rhizomes may become highly branched with age
  but are not creeping or spreading [74,189]. Most western swordfern
  plants studied on the Olympic Peninsula consisted of a single
  rhizome segment supporting a single ramet; 5% of the plants had more
  than one ramet emerging from a branched rhizome [132] (see Botanical
  Description). Although the species often occurs in pure, uniform
  stands, these stands probably represent populations of individual
  sporophytes rather than colonies [74].

  <li> SUCCESSIONAL STATUS: Western swordfern is typically present
  during most stages of stand development [144]. It can establish in
    primary succession, such as after deglaciation or volcanic eruption,
  and in early secondary succession, but typically reaches its best
  growth and greatest abundance in mid- to late-successional forests
  [181].

Regarding succession, the same Forest Service web site summarizes:

<blockquote>

The general sequence begins with an herbaceous stage dominated by nonresident annual and perennial
herbs, which typically lasts 4 or 5 years; residual herbs, such as western swordfern, may contribute
substantial cover during this stage.

</blockquote>

Resilience after disturbance:

<blockquote>

Western swordfern communities tended to have greater resilience than other community types in the HJ
Andrews Experimental Forest. A series of studies used long-term sampling of permanent plots before
and after clearcutting and slash burning in 100- to 500-year-old Douglas-fir forest
[52,77,78]. Initial understory in the western swordfern community was richer and more structurally
complex than in most other communities, and surviving perennial herbs and shrubs were abundant,
resulting in relatively rapid community recovery. The resilience of the western swordfern community
was attributed to the ability of dominant herb and shrub species to sprout from subterranean
structures following slash burning, and western swordfern "regenerated continuously from surviving
rhizomes or stem bases" [77,78]. Abundance of understory dominants, including western swordfern, was
reduced during the first 2 years after slash burning, when wind-dispersed annuals such as tall
annual willowherb and nonnative woodland ragwort dominated. This was followed by increases of
initially subordinate (e.g., sweetscented bedstraw) and dominant (e.g., western swordfern) forest
herbs. Shrubs began to dominate 14 years after disturbance. Trees did not dominate until after 20
years [52,78]. See the Research Project Summary of these studies for more information.

</blockquote>  

Succession of fungal endophytes:
<blockquote>
Fungal endophytes of many taxa initially inhabit pinnae, but within 30
days, in one report (Younginger and Ballhorn, 2017) increase in number
but radically decrease in diversity, becoming dominated by
Flagellospora fusarioides.

<h4>Variable foliar uptake</h4>

This is an important source of water for ferns in redwood forests, where summer fog is common.
<p>
  However, this is not obligatory:

  <blockquote>

    Western swordfern's foliar uptake capacity and morphological characteristics vary with latitude
    in the redwood forest zone (Table 1), with its greatest foliar uptake capacity in the central
    part of the zone and no foliar uptake capacity at the southern end [133].
