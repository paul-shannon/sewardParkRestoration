<center><h3>DNA Sequencing for a Pathogen</h3></center>

Dylan Mendenhall (for the Friends of Seward Park) and Dr. Ylva Lekberg
(soil ecologist at Montana's MPG Ranch, working pro bono) and Mary
Ellyn Dupre (also of MPG Ranch) collaborated to sequence samples taken
from affected and unaffected sword ferns at Seward Park.

38 samples were provided to Ylva's lab: 34 from rhizomes, 4 from affected
fronds.  Ylva has suggested a different sample selection strategy
if we have the chance to do this again.

grateful to Ylva, Mary Ellyn and Dylan for their work.
