<center><h3>Testable Hypotheses</h3></center>

We wish to learn the cause or causes of the sword fern die-off.
<P>
Seven years of observation and small-scale experiments have not produced an explanation.
<P>
We seek testable hypotheses.  With each one, where costs and benefits
permit, we will accumulate evidence to support it, or to contradict.
In time, this should lead to a mechanistic understanding of the
die-off, and perhaps to remedies or mitigating strategies.
<p>

Here are some of the hypotheses already suggested, in no particular order, all tentative, some
addressed at length elsewhere on this site, all an invitation to brainstorming and discussion:

<ol>

  <li> drought

  <li> water-borne pathogen

  <li> invasive earthworms

  <li> compromised protective fungal endophyte

  <li> compromised mycellal networks

  <li> moutain beaver herbivory

  <li> thrips

  <li> phytophthora

  <li> some other pathogen introduced during 2011 10,000 bare-root cedar planting, in which
  vanishingly few cedars survived

  <li> roughly synchronous mortality of natural (~600 year?) same-age-cohort 

</ol>
