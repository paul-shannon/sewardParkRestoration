<center><h3>Testable Hypotheses</h3></center>

We wish to learn the cause or causes of the sword fern die-off.
<P>
Seven years of observation and small-scale experiments have not produced an explanation.
<P>
We seek testable hypotheses.  With each one, where costs and benefits
permit, we will accumulate evidence to support it, or to contradict.
In time, this should lead to a mechanistic understanding of the
die-off, and perhaps to remedies or mitigating strategies.
<p>

Here are some of the hypotheses already suggested, in no particular order, all tentative, some
addressed at length elsewhere on this site, all an invitation to brainstorming and discussion:

<ol>

  <li> drought: substantial evidence against

  <li> water-borne pathogen: moderate evidence for

  <li> invasive earthworms: no anecdotal support, deserves more attention

  <li> compromised protective fungal endophyte: unexplored possibility

  <li> compromised mycellal networks: unexplored possibilty

  <li> moutain beaver herbivory: substantial evidence against

  <li> thrips: little evidence for

  <li> phytophthora: unlikely, after lots of work

  <li> some other pathogen introduced during 2011 10,000 bare-root cedar planting, in which
  vanishingly few cedars survived:  sequencing could be helpful

  <li> roughly synchronous mortality of natural (~600 year?) same-age-cohort: untested, species
    baseline mortality unknown

  <li> A leafhopper, Eupteryx filicum, has recently immigrated from England.  Al Smith reports
  finding these on sword ferns at Seward, and suggests they may vector a pathogen.
