<center><h3>Baseline Mortality</h3></center>

We know little about the normal (baseline) mortality of sword ferns.
<p>
  
This comment from the forest service describes one circumstance in
which mortality has been observed.  I could find no other reports or
mention.

<blockquote>
In the absence of severe soil disturbance, western swordfern usually
persists or reestablishes from surviving rhizomes following overstory
mortality at most scales. Exceptions may be found on exposed and/or
dry sites where moisture stress is severe and at the extremes of
its range, where sites may already be marginal for western swordfern
and become less habitable with soil and canopy disturbance.
  </blockquote>

Malia and Sucia Islands, north of Orcas Island in the San Juans, both
have extensive mostly undisturbed forest, with extensive sword fern
communities.  Such a site, if surveyed non-destructively, may provide
insight into baseline mortality, on the hypothesis that dead rhizome
crowns persist, visibly, for a decade or more, and could be counted at
ground level.
