<h3 style="margin-top: 20px"> Small Ivy Patch, East Side #</h3>

Discovered from the lower loop road, a small patch almost contiguous
with the big hatchery site.  One sturdy holly tree in the middle of
this patch, previously cut and resprouted, suggests the area may have
been cleared before, maybe as part of ivyOUT in the early 2000s.
