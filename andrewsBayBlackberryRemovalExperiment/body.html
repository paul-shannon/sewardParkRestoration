<h3 style="margin:10px"> Andrews Bay HBB Removal Experiment </h3>

This small project started in the summer of 2018, and proceeded in
small slow stages.  Himalayan Blackberries (HBB) dominated everywhere,
to a height of 3 feet, up to the turquoise PVC drainage pipe.  With
lots of help from Leo Shannon (HBB clearing) and from Irene Munger
(planting and mulching) we completed work in April 2008.
<p>
The project has been explicitly an experiment, to try to answer these
questions:
<ul>
  <li> How much effort is required to remove 400 sq ft of HBB, so that
    they do not soon return, resprouting from remnant roots?</li>
  <li> Can the thin soil nearest the lake support restoration
    planting?</li>
  <li> Will park visitors respect the plantings?</li>
  <li> Will full ground cover emerge?
</ul>

All of the plants put in within 10 feet of the shore are dead and
gone, likely a consequence of yachters using this area, now that it is
cleared of blackberries, for embarking and disembarking small craft.
<p>
I water the remaining plants about every two weeks using water carried
from the lake in a bucket.

<h4>Proposed by Eric Sterner (2 May 2019):</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Hardhack:  5
  <li> Snowberry: 10
  <li> Nootka rose: 4
  <li> Slough sedge: 6
  <li> Small-fruited bulrush:  6
  <li> Madrone: 3
  <li> Pacific Willow: 3
</ul>

<h3>Status (August 2020):</h3>

The 400 sq. ft. of cleared and mulched ground remains free of HBB.
All plants within 15 feet of the shore are dead and gone, due to  two
independent or combined factors:
<ol>
  <li>Relatively little soil in those 15 feet - just mulch on top of
  small glacial till (golf ball to baseball sized rocks)</li>
  <li>Frequent use by yachters (see photos) traveling to and from
  their boats by dinghy.</li>
</ol> 
Snowberry and nootka rose appear to be the principal survivors.

<h3>Overview, with dinghy, many plants already dead and gone (July 2020):</h3>
I cannot find <i>before</i> photos.  In their place, imagine the
mulched ground beyond the turquoise pipe entirely filled with
blackberries to a height of three feet.
<p>
An offical "Boat Landing Zone" is 50 feet further along the shore.  It
is largely overgrown with blackberry, and so is less inviting than the
newly cleared restoration site.
<p>
If Seattle Parks and the Friends of Seward Park wish to see this
project through to a successful completion, there are two or three tasks which
may be needed:
<ol>
  <li>Install disincentives to dinghy docking, perhaps CWD from the
    two snags (cedar and cherry) shown nearby in brown on the map.</li>
  <li>Plant again in the 15 feet near the shore, with glacial till
  and mulch possibly augmented by soil.</li>
  <li> Incentivize dinghy docking in the official nearby Boat
  Landing Zone.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Boat Landing Zone (July 2020):</h3>
Looking down from the lower loop road, about 20 yards up the shore
from the blackberry removal site.  This is the official dinghy docking
spot.  Covid-19 and scarce resources
no doubt contribute to delayed Parks maintenance of this location.
Our restoration spot now seems to be preferred.

<h3>Left Side (July 2020):</h3>
Looking up from the lake and to the left.  This area was grubbed, but
not so thoroughly as the right side.  Occasional HBB sprouts appear; I
inermittently do followup grubbing here.
