<h3 style="margin-top: 20px"> Cedar Snag with Burned Out Core, Tree 74</h3>

Like cedar #72b, and of comparable height, but this tree's core is
exposed throught the tree's full height.   Burn visible only in lower
six feet.
<p>
There are three medium-to-big firs nearby: 14', 24' and 30' away, with
DBH respectively of 3'9", 3'2", 4'5" DBH respectively.  No apparent
burned bark.  Perhaps these three first seeded in 
 after the fire - which, we conjecture, happened 250-300 years ago.

<ul>
  <li> DBH: 3'1"
  <li> First observed: 19 dec 2020
  <li> Observer: Paul Shannon
  <li> Burn: entire core below six feet
  <li> About 24' heigh
</ul>
