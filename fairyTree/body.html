<h3 style="margin-top: 20px"> Site introduction </h3>
In 2012, the Friends of Seward Park with strategic support from Michael Yadrick
of Seattle Parks, and help from the staff and students from the Wilderness Awareness
School, installed snow fencing and plants in pursuit of two goals:
<ol>
   <li> Revegetate the most impacted areas of this site, especially
     the hard-packed soil at the entrance from the Lost Lake Trail,
     and along the right low ridge extending from the doug fir at the
     entrance. 
     <li> Encourage ongoing use of the tree, especially for children.
</ol>

The entrance area is now (2020, 8 years later) in pretty good shape.
But the region beyond the fairy tree's upturned rootball, and the
previous cedar tree understory to the right, are both heavily trampled
and denuded.
<p>
A July 9th meeting between the Seattle Parks Natural Area Crew (NAC) -
Chris Baines and Bridget Kelsh - plant ecologist Eric Sterner, and the
Friends of Seward Park produced a plan:

<ol>
  <li> mulch the ground heavily (accomplished quickly by the NAC, July 2020)
  <li> construct log and branch barriers to discourage use below the
      cedar tree and beyond (a certain distance beyond) the upturned
    rootball (pending).
    <li> We discussed <i>growing</i> an obstacle fence, or perhaps devising
    a hybrid structure/live plant barrier, to replace the 2012 snow
    fencing and to protect beyond the root ball and below the cedar tree.
</ol>

<h3>Site walkthrough, before mulching 19 jul 2020</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Notice the bare-ground - no surviving understory - at <b>40-49
      seconds</b>, beneath the cedar tree.   
  This area had not yet been trampled three years ago. The
  understory was continuous from the boardwalk to the root ball.

<h3>Site walkthrough, after mulching 23 jul 2020</h3>

<ul>
  <li> The bare-ground/destroyed understory spot is moderately blocked
      off with branches and CWD (coarse woody debris).  This may not be enough to
      deter more use.

<h3>Beneath the Cedar: protection dwindling away</h3>

There are now two almost uninterrupted access routes from the
boardwalk into this unfortunate clearing.  Though undoubtedly fun for
the young visitors who clamber around here, in what was once dense
understory, their impact is harsh.

<h3>Beneath the Cedar: minor construction</h3>
An informal fort has been constructed beneath the cedar, with
medium-sized branches collected, leaned against the trunk.  There is
no trace of the once thriving understory.

<h3>Barrier Logs Installed, below the cedar, 3 sep 2020</h3>
Chris Bain and his NAC crew brought in some big logs, and installed them
as barriers to travel in two places:
<ol>
  <li> below the cedar tree
  <li> about 15' behind the rootball.
</ol>
<p><p> This is very fine work - we are really grateful to Chris, the
    NAC, and to Seattle Parks.  I propose (this will be a good forest
    steward + volunteers job) to bring in large amounts and variety of
    coarse wood and branches to further deter travel into these areas,
    and to speed the recovery of the trampled &amp; compacted ground -
    a good job for forest stewards and volunteers.
