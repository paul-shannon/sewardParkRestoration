<h3 style="margin-top: 20px">High Ground Die-off</h3>

This area (about 5 acres) in enclosed by the sqebeqsed and Windfall
Trails, occupying the highest ground in the forest.  The southern
quarter - our focus here - is dominated by large sword ferns with few other understory
plants.
<p>
In January I found that about 3% of the ferns in these five acres were
dead, all of them intermittently distributed, no regions of contiguous
death.
<p>
Now, October 2nd 2020, and with sorrow, I report that contiguous die-off
has appeared, showing what seem to be the classic signs of the die-off.
<p>
It is always possible that this is a transient phenomenon, 
strictly limited to the small area picture below, and not the first
appearance of concentrated die-off.  Time will tell.
