"Ground Zero" is the original quarter-acre of dramatic sword fern
die-off we witnessed in 2014 and 2015.   This formerly 
Seattle Parks hired a contractor to do restoration planting throughout the larger Ground Zero
area, implemented in the first quarter of 2019. Survival assay about
15 months later, in May 2020.

<h3>Before the die-off (2010?)</h3>
Very healthy understory, before the 2014-15 die-off.  This photo was
taken looking east, down the Hatchery Trail.  The replanted area is on the
right, only partly visible in this photo of uncertain date.
