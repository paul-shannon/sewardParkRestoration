<h3 style="margin-top: 20px">Five-year Fern Survival Experiment, 2018-2023</h3>

In February 2018, with some guidance from Verdant LLC, and generous
support from Seattle Parks, Suzanne Bouchard and I planted young
nursery sword ferns at and near Ground Zero in Seward Park.  This is
an ongoing experiment, to last at least five years.  

<p>
The die-off at Ground Zero had reached steady state by 2014, leaving
almost entirely bare ground.  10% of the original ferns, as we
assessed in a June 2019 study.  This quarter acre was subject to
erosion and likely undergoing further ecological degradation:
underground mycorrhizal networks need photosynthesizing plants, of
which there were very few.  No natural restoration had taken place
until a few fringecups - most happily - appeared in 2019.
<p>

Suzanne and planted three lines of 12 ferns, two lines at Ground Zero,
1 line just north of what was then the boundary of the expanding
die-off region.  I hypothesized that the agent of the die-off,
whatever it turns out to be, was no longer active at Ground Zero, but
that it was likely to be active and virulent at the die-off's leading
edge.

<p>
This hypothesis was a generalization from a single fern planted at
Ground Zero in 2014.  Inspecting the die-off with Seattle Parks plant
ecologist Jillian Weed, I asked, "What should we do?".  "Monitor
closely", she said, "and why don't you plant a couple of nursery
ferns?".  We did, I watered the pair through a couple of summers, and
one (dubbed "Jillian Weed #1") is thriving now six years later.  A 50%
survival rate for restoration planting is better than I usually
achieve.  So I surmised that the die-off agent/s were gone - at least
temporarily.

<p>
I water all 36 plants weekly during summer drought, two liters per
palnt.  The Ground Zero ferns (with one exception) are thriving.  The
northern line ("ADZ" for active die-off zone) is about 50% dead or
dying.  I have made every attempt to treat all three lines
identically.
<p>

In April 2020, Bonnie Drew, Jeff Kelley and I twice independently surveyed
all three lines.  We counted fiddleheads, interpreting them as simple
markers of overall plant health.  Here are the results, summarized for
each of the three 12-fern lines, in box plot form.  The full dataset
is available on request.  We are grateful to Dylan Mendenhall for his
analysis, on this and other projects.
<p>

I provisionally conclude that there is currently no active agent
affecting ferns at Ground Zero.  The degraded site is now recovering,
which is very fine to see.

<p>
The agent - still unidentified - may return.

<h3>2021 survival stats</h3>
Thirty-eight months after planting.
Third year of 5-year 36 experimental fern planting: "Ground Zero" ferns still thriving
<p>

In February 2018, we planted 3 lines of nursery sword ferns, 12 plants
per line, hypothesizing that those planted into Ground Zero (GZN, GZS)
would survive, but that those planted into (actually just ahead of)
the active die-off zone (ADZ) zone would not do well.  All 36 plants
have been watered through three summers.  The prediction continues to
hold:
<p>

  <ul>
    <li> ADZ: 5/12 ferns dead, 2 are marginal, 5 healthy
    <li> GZS: 1/12 ferns dead, 11 healthy
    <li> GZN: all 12 ferns are healthy
    <li> t.test pvalue, likelihood of this difference occurring by
      chance: 8.7e-4
  </ul>
  
We surmise that the presumed pathogen no longer resides at Ground Zero
- but could possibly return.  A continuous dense population of
affected sword ferns may be needed for reinfection: the GZ sword ferns
may be "socially distant" from current areas of active die-off.

Thanks again to Bonnie Drew and Jeff Kelley for their help in counting fronds.
