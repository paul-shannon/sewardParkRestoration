In February 2018, with some guidance from Verdant LLC, and generous
support from Seattle Parks, Suzanne Bouchard and I planted young
nursery sword ferns at and near Ground Zero in Seward Park.  This is
an ongoing experiment, to last at least five years.  

<p>
The die-off at Ground Zero had reached steady state by 2014, leaving
almost entirely bare ground.  10% of the original ferns, as we
assessed in a June 2019 study.  This quarter acre was subject to
erosion and likely undergoing further ecological degradation:
underground mycorrhizal networks need photosynthesizing plants, of
which there were very few.  No natural restoration had taken place
until a few fringecups - most happily - appeared in 2019.
<p>

Suzanne and planted three lines of 12 ferns, two lines at Ground Zero,
1 line just north of what was then the boundary of the expanding
die-off region.  I hypothesized that the agent of the die-off,
whatever it turns out to be, was no longer active at Ground Zero, but
that it was likely to be active and virulent at the die-off's leading
edge.

<p>
This hypothesis was a generalization from a single fern planted at
Ground Zero in 2014.  Inspecting the die-off with Seattle Parks plant
ecologist Jillian Weed, I asked, "What should we do?".  "Monitor
closely", she said, "and why don't you plant a couple of nursery
ferns?".  We did, I watered the pair through a couple of summers, and
one (dubbed "Jillian Weed #1") is thriving now six years later.  A 50%
survival rate for restoration planting is better than I usually
achieve.  So I surmised that the die-off agent/s were gone - at least
temporarily.

<p>
I water all 36 plants weekly during summer drought, two liters per
palnt.  The Ground Zero ferns (with one exception) are thriving.  The
northern line ("ADZ" for active die-off zone) is about 50% dead or
dying.  I have made every attempt to treat all three lines
identically.
<p>

In April 2020, Bonnie Drew, Jeff Kelley and I twice independently surveyed
all three lines.  We counted fiddleheads, interpreting them as simple
markers of overall plant health.  Here are the results, summarized for
each of the three 12-fern lines, in box plot form.  The full dataset
is available on request.  We are grateful to Dylan Mendenhall for his
analysis, on this and other projects.
<p>

I provisionally conclude that there is currently no active agent
affecting ferns at Ground Zero.  The degraded site is now recovering,
which is very fine to see.

<p>
The agent - still unidentified - may of course return.
