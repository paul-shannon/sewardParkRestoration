<h2> Citizen Scientists find that Hemlocks are dying, but old-growth Douglas Firs are healthy
  in Seward Park </h2>

Seward Park, in southeast Seattle, includes a rare 100-acre old-growth
forest.  Ancient doug firs, 300-500 years old, and up to 7 feet in
diameter, form the backbone of this forest, part of and supporting a web of life:
bald eagles, barred owls, pileated woodpeckers, coyotes, sword ferns
and Oregon grape, mountain beavers, red cedar, western hemlock, the
graceful beaked hazelnut.

<p>
As we see throughout the city; as has been observed across the
continent; and as our last summer citizen science survey established:
many tree species are in decline.   CHOOSE 180 interns spent 6 weeks
in 2021 measuring and assessing 116 western hemlocks, establishing
that they are in rapid decline.  Here we see the interns at work in
the forest, followed by a map of the project's results.   Western Hemlocks -
the Washington state tree - resident in this forest for an estimated
6000 years, will soon be vanishingly rare at Seward Park.

<p>
Following an account of the 2021 survey, we present the 2022 project,
in which once again CHOOSE 180 interns joined with the Friends of
Seward Park, and two UW interns, to survey Douglas Fir mortality in
the forest.

<h3> 2022: The Doug Fir Mortality Project</h3>

Following up on our 2021 work, and with renewed support from CHOOSE
180 and the intern program at UW's College of the Envionment and
Biology Department, and with the oversight and guidance from UW's
Dr. Tim Billo, we tested out our hunch:  that though hemlocks and red
cedar are in precipitous decline, the magnificent old Douglas-Firs are
in good health.
<p>
Our methods were simple.  We developed a simple mathematical model
to  predicts the number of years a fallen doug fir has been on the
ground.  We cobmined multiple measures of decay and an estimate of epiphyte coverage
(the number of nursling plants growing on the log).  Citizen
naturalists - neighobrs who visit and meticulously observe Seward's
forest, often daily - gave us fall dates on a dozen trees that fell in
the last 30 years.  Historical data added more detail.   The model is
impressionistic, but plausible.   And to our delight, we found that
firs mortality rate has held steady over the last sixty years - that
these beautiful trees are robust against the increased drought, storms
and heat of the last 20-30 years.

<p> Though we are pessimistic about the survival of this rare remnant
  old-growth forest in its historical form, we are hopeful that the
  majestic old firs - mother trees all - will survive, flourish, and
  be the foundation of the next forest - whatever that turns out to be
  - now taking shape at Seward Park

<p> CHOOSE 180 interns, UW students, and UW's Tim Billo have been
  indispensable in developing this understanding of Seward Park's
  Magnificent Forest.
